An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted , Intuitive , Thinking , and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one. “Thought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.” Blaise Pascal It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them. A Pioneering Spirit Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people’s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval – in fact, they rather enjoy it. But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn’t worth anything unless it actually works. Architects want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. And heaven help anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism. Architects, independent to the core, want to shake off other people’s expectations and pursue their own ideas. This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. Architects don’t mind acting alone, perhaps because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also generally prefer making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration other people’s thoughts, desires, and plans. It would be a mistake, however, to view Architects as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, these personalities feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, Architects are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. They may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, but they are authentically human. A Thirst for Knowledge Architects can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. They believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. But these personalities may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity. People with the Architect personality type derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, they may have been called “bookworms” or “nerds.” But rather than taking these labels as insults, many Architects embrace them. They recognize their own ability to teach themselves about – and master – any topic that interests them, whether that’s coding or capoeira or classical music. Architects don’t just learn new things for show – they genuinely enjoy expanding the limits of their knowledge. Architects can be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, they’re far from dull or humorless. Many Architects are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor. Social Frustrations Architects aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. This may explain why so many fictional villains are modeled on this personality type. Because Architects value truth and depth, many common social practices – from small talk to white lies – may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they’re only trying to be honest. At times, Architects may wonder whether dealing with other people is even worth the frustration. But like any personality type, Architects do crave social interaction – they’d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When Architects pursue their interests, their natural confidence can draw people to them – professionally, socially, and even romantically. The Chess Game of Life Architects are full of contradictions. They are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of the Architect mind. For these personalities, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, Architects contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Scrape all"],"metadata":{"id":"7rpo8yM1e8Nf"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Base URL\n","base_url = \"https://www.16personalities.com\"\n","\n","# Personalities and sections\n","personalities = [\"/intj\", \"/intp\", \"/entj\", \"/entp\", \"/infj\", \"/infp\", \"/enfj\", \"/enfp\", \"/istj\", \"/isfj\", \"/estj\", \"/esfj\", \"/istp\", \"/isfp\", \"/estp\", \"/esfp\"]\n","sections = [\"personality\", \"strengths-and-weaknesses\", \"relationships-dating\", \"friends\", \"parents\", \"careers\"]\n","\n","# Initialize a DataFrame\n","df = pd.DataFrame(index=personalities, columns=sections)\n","\n","# Function to extract content\n","def extract_content(url):\n","    response = requests.get(url)\n","    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n","    content_section = soup.find('article', {'role': 'main', 'class': 'main description'})\n","    return ' '.join(content_section.stripped_strings) if content_section else 'Content not found'\n","\n","# Scrape the content for each personality and each section\n","for personality in personalities:\n","    for section in sections:\n","        # Create the full URL for the personality section\n","        full_url = f\"{base_url}{personality}-{section}\"\n","        # Extract the content\n","        content = extract_content(full_url)\n","        # Store the content in the DataFrame\n","        df.loc[personality, section] = content\n"],"metadata":{"id":"-bJv9rjGLgvJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701657914186,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":27888,"user":{"displayName":"Qifeng Sun","userId":"00073716913624073351"}}},"execution_count":42,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Rename the index and specific columns\n","df.index.rename('Personality Type', inplace=True)\n","df.rename(columns={\n","    'personality': 'Personality Type Background',\n","    'relationships-dating': 'Romantic Relationships',\n","    'at-work': 'Workplace'\n","}, inplace=True)\n","\n","# Strip the leading slash from the index values to get just the uppercase personality type codes\n","df.index = df.index.str.strip('/').str.upper()"],"metadata":{"id":"QmQESMhLfBiI","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701657914187,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"Qifeng Sun","userId":"00073716913624073351"}}},"execution_count":43,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"u1oGaJgQgvyK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701658190958,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":333,"user":{"displayName":"Qifeng Sun","userId":"00073716913624073351"}},"outputId":"26fdbe22-c3e1-4aef-9b37-865bf8e70531"},"execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                        Personality Type Background  \\\n","Personality Type                                                      \n","INTJ              Introduction Who is An Architect (INTJ)?

But what happens when we add one more characteristic to the mix: Identity ? Both Assertive Architects (INTJ-A) and Turbulent Architects (INTJ-T) maintain their similarities and value the same things, but with a twist that adds important, functional nuance to their expression of Architect qualities. This Identity difference probably influences every part of their lives in some way. For our purposes (and for brevity’s sake), we’ll explore a few of the more apparent areas where our research shows a gap between the two types of Architects. Are you a Turbulent Architect? Check out “Turbulent Architect Superpowers” at the bottom of this article for the deepest insights into who you are. Expressing Ambition Differently Assertive Architects are likely to approach the things they do with a greater degree of self-assurance. These Architects feel more confident about handling the stressors that are inevitably a part of life. They are less likely to experience regret if things go wrong. So, stressors and past failures are less likely to be motivators. However, confidence isn’t everything and may not always guarantee success. For Turbulent Architects, many of their best efforts come from concerns about real or perceived shortcomings. This may push them to work harder and be more meticulous in an attempt to do better or make things better. These personalities are more thorough – not despite the fact that they worry, but because they do worry. Turbulent Architects are likely to carry their diligent desire for improvement into any of their personal or professional endeavors. 93% of Assertive Architects trust themselves to overcome any challenges life can throw their way, compared to 71% of Turbulent Architects. “RELYING ON OTHERS” SURVEY All Architect personalities feel fairly confident when facing challenges and regard rational problem-solving highly. But Turbulent Architects more typically find any imperfections in a system very early in the process. This is due to their more worrisome nature, which creates a kind of hypervigilance. Their analytical nature then helps them find useful solutions, sometimes even before others realize such a solution is needed. This foresight can create a solid reputation that elevates them at work and at home. However, this doesn’t mean that Turbulent Architects always follow through on the solutions they develop. The same apprehension that allows these personalities to find problems early in the process might also prevent them from mentioning such flaws to others. “How can this go wrong?” might be replaced by, “What if I’m wrong?” This new question may stifle any impulse to share insights and solutions. 49% of Turbulent Architects are often afraid of making decisions, compared to 18% of Assertive Architects. “NEED FOR CONTROL” SURVEY Both types of Architects lean toward being ambitious. But there’s a potential trap in thinking that Assertive Architects are less ambitious than their Turbulent counterparts because they come across as less intense. Their confidence may make them look like they are effortlessly and casually cruising along with few signs of visible stress. Some may interpret this relaxed demeanor as apathy. Assertive Architects can care as much as Turbulent Architects – it’s just that their motivation comes from somewhere different. It comes more from within rather than from without and from a place of certainty rather than uncertainty. This allows for a steadier gait that’s less influenced by any fluctuations around them. Their confidence places a lot of faith in their logic and understanding, and that conviction glides Assertive Architect personalities toward their accomplishments. Dealing with Change and the Unexpected The slightly more adventurous Assertive Architects are likely to feel better equipped to handle whatever life throws at them – especially with strategies and decision-making. They are more likely than Turbulent Architects to report that they believe bad luck has a positive side. To these personalities, things are rarely so dire that they can’t handle them. While they prefer stability, they’re not likely to fear instability. However, Assertive Architect personalities can be a little more rigid than their Turbulent counterparts with intentional change. While they can be forward-thinking and visionary, they may see more mundane things as being fine just as they are, with no need to alter anything on a practical level. They may not have the impetus of improvement behind their regard for change and may not feel as much of a need to apply smaller tweaks to a system. But this is not so for Turbulent Architects. Though influenced by their stability-oriented Judging personality trait, they’re somewhat more likely than Assertive Architects to say they often change both their long- and short-term goals. 32% of Turbulent Architects say they often change their long-term goals, compared to 17% of Assertive Architects. “TEMPTATION” SURVEY While neither Architect is typically big on changing their goals, a relative willingness to change is a true Turbulent difference. Turbulent personality types, with an eye always aimed at improvement, commonly deal with the moving targets and shifting methods that are often necessary to change something for the better. As much as Turbulent Architects value stability and consistency, they will shake things up – but only if doing so clearly paves the way to better results. Responding to the People in Their Lives: The Same but Different While both are sometimes uncomfortable expressing feelings, Turbulent Architects are relatively more likely to let their emotions play a role. These personalities consistently report, for example, that they are more easily provoked and more likely to feel fear – especially fear of uncertainty. More Turbulent Architects say they are emotionally expressive in general when compared to their Assertive counterparts. 81% of Assertive Architects say they are rarely or very rarely offended by someone, compared to 41% of Turbulent Architects. “BEING OFFENDED” SURVEY Humans are emotional creatures. Turbulent Architects’ different levels of expressiveness and relative need for people may give them an advantage over Assertive Architects for connecting with others. Turbulent Architects may get more buy-in for their ideas from others because of their more approachable, open attitude. They are also more likely to feel the need to ask for advice – but then find it more difficult than Assertive personalities to make the request. Nonetheless, it shows that they value what others have to offer. Assertive Architects are likely to take a somewhat more independent approach. A larger percentage of Assertive Architects report that they’re comfortable around authority figures than their Turbulent counterparts. These Assertive personality types may not be as held back by concern over how others might judge them – potentially creating a more independent attitude. 72% of Turbulent Architects feel pressured to live up to a certain standard (e.g., home, car, salary), compared to 45% of Assertive Architects. “SOCIAL PRESSURES” SURVEY There are certain advantages to this difference. More independent actors, like the Assertive Architects, may have greater autonomy and enjoy a more streamlined decision-making process. Depending on the task, a single person can often be agile in a way that a group cannot. But independence can also make them appear unwilling to listen to others or take their needs and wants seriously. This can make collaboration and teamwork difficult. In Summary Turbulent Architects are often fueled by their worries and concerns, and these can be used to make significant progress. They can often see problems (and sometimes find solutions) long before others. Stress affects Assertive Architects less, but this should not be confused with their not caring. Both types of Architects are often ambitious – but their motivations are different. Assertive Architects are motivated more from within, and their inspiration to act is based on confidence in their rationality. Turbulent Architects are moved forward in life to a greater degree by their concerns, worries, and how others might see them. While neither personality type is likely to be very comfortable with their emotions, Turbulent Architects are more likely to express theirs and use them to connect with others by being more approachable. Assertive Architects are less likely to be as concerned about the opinions of others. They relish their independence and make decisions on their own. Both personality types need order and predictability, but Assertive Architects are slightly more adventurous than Turbulent Architects. They prefer stability but don’t necessarily fear instability. However, Turbulent Architects are often more willing to change intentionally than their Assertive cousins. Shared Foundations When we focus on the Identity personality traits, it’s important to remember that one is not better or more legitimate than the other. A Turbulent Architect is no less of an Architect than an Assertive Architect, and vice versa. It’s like spice in a stew. All the main ingredients are there – but add some savory spices to increase its sweetness, sourness, or heat, and the stew is suddenly something a bit different. The world needs confident Architects to boldly present their many ideas and insights. It also needs cautious Architects to anticipate problems and to care about and respond to opinions. Their unique differences, no matter how subtle or pronounced, can contribute to the world – each in their own ways.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#"],"metadata":{"id":"o4Mzb22IvJUs"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Base URL\n","base_url = \"https://www.16personalities.com\"\n","\n","# Mapping of personality codes to full names\n","personality_names = {\n","    \"intj\": \"architect\",\n","    \"intp\": \"logician\",\n","    \"entj\": \"commander\",\n","    \"entp\": \"debater\",\n","    \"infj\": \"advocate\",\n","    \"infp\": \"mediator\",\n","    \"enfj\": \"protagonist\",\n","    \"enfp\": \"campaigner\",\n","    \"istj\": \"logistician\",\n","    \"isfj\": \"defender\",\n","    \"estj\": \"executive\",\n","    \"esfj\": \"consul\",\n","    \"istp\": \"virtuoso\",\n","    \"isfp\": \"adventurer\",\n","    \"estp\": \"entrepreneur\",\n","    \"esfp\": \"entertainer\"\n","}\n","\n","# Function to extract content from a given URL\n","def extract_content(url):\n","    response = requests.get(url)\n","    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n","    content_section = soup.find('div', class_='article-content')\n","    return ' '.join(content_section.stripped_strings) if content_section else 'Content not found'\n","\n","# Initialize a DataFrame to hold the extracted content\n","df_avs_t = pd.DataFrame(columns=['A vs T'])\n","\n","# Scrape the A vs T content for each personality\n","for code, name in personality_names.items():\n","    # Construct the URL using the personality name and code\n","    avs_t_url = f\"{base_url}/articles/assertive-{name}-{code}-a-vs-turbulent-{name}-{code}-t\"\n","    # Extract the content\n","    avs_t_content = extract_content(avs_t_url)\n","    # Add the extracted content to the DataFrame\n","    df_avs_t.loc[code.upper(), 'A vs T'] = avs_t_content\n","\n","# Assuming df is your original DataFrame with personality codes as the index\n","# Convert the index of df to uppercase to match df_avs_t for a successful join\n","df.index = df.index.str.upper()\n","\n","# Join the new A vs T content DataFrame with the original DataFrame\n","df_combined = df.join(df_avs_t)"],"metadata":{"id":"tBD5C0-airHm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701658414088,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":5119,"user":{"displayName":"Qifeng Sun","userId":"00073716913624073351"}}},"execution_count":53,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_combined"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"NXLZ65xijbub","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1701660391842,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":457,"user":{"displayName":"Qifeng Sun","userId":"00073716913624073351"}},"outputId":"029473b2-1367-4a7d-8b5c-500ac842b364"},"execution_count":59,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                        Personality Type Background  \\\n","Personality Type                                                      \n","INTJ              Introduction Who is An Architect (INTJ)?
