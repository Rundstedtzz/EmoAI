Dating Virtuoso personalities is a tango, complex and interesting, with alternating coldness and detachment, and passion, spontaneity and enjoyment of the moment. Nothing can be forced in Virtuoso relationships, but so long as they are given the space they need to be themselves, they will gladly enjoy the comforts of a steady partner for a lifetime. An Independent Heart Early in dating, people with the Virtuoso personality type can be especially flighty \u2013 they live in the present, always looking for new activities and experiences. If a potential partner doesn\u2019t measure up, Virtuosos have no real problem walking away. Virtuosos also need a great deal of personal space, both physically and mentally, and any attempts to control them or forcibly schedule their activities only accelerates their departure. On the other hand, Virtuosos have no problem trying to change their partners\u2019 habits, most likely with attempts to get them to loosen up a bit and relax and have fun. Virtuoso personalities are hardly strict or traditional when it comes to dating, and often try to introduce sex into their activities early on. Sensual individuals that they are, Virtuosos make ready use of all of their senses, viewing intimacy as an art, a performance, and a source of pleasure. As their relationships progress, Virtuosos\u2019 partners tend to find that intimacy is about the closest they get to open emotional expression. It\u2019s not that Virtuosos don\u2019t have feelings \u2013 they actually run quite deep and strong \u2013 just that they conceal and protect them because they are unsure how to deal with them and express them. Virtuosos have no trouble leaving something they think is mutually understood unsaid. This applies in a broader sense in Virtuosos\u2019 relationships as well. Any attempts to push understood arrangements, even the relationships themselves, into open discussion in order to secure commitment, especially early on, are often met by Virtuosos with something close to panic. Nothing is so acutely terrifying to Virtuosos as knowing that there\u2019s no way out. Every day is a new day, and Virtuosos review their obligations from moment to moment. If Virtuosos are to be lifelong partners, it must happen as a natural progression of these day-to-day decisions, on their own time. None of this should be taken too personally by Virtuosos\u2019 partners \u2013 it\u2019s just how their minds work. People with this personality type live in the present, in a world of physical activities that engage the senses, and they just need to know that they have the freedom to be passionate about something one day and indifferent the next, without being grilled on when they\u2019re going to finish something, or why they\u2019ve \u201csuddenly changed their minds\u201d. At the same time, being a little more expressive and a little more comfortable with the idea of consistency and follow-through can go a long way in rounding out the Virtuoso personality type. The best partners usually share Virtuosos\u2019 Observant (S) trait, that interest in what the world is here and now, with one or two opposing traits to help them to explore a world that also involves other people and others\u2019 expectations."}]}

Wealth, power, structure, advancement and security are all lesser goals to Adventurer personalities\u2019 greatest need: creative freedom. Adventurers crave a tangible outlet for their imagination, a chance to express themselves artistically. Those placing their emphasis on predictability and long-term planning find that attempts to push those views on Adventurers are about as effective as forcing open flames to point downwards. People with the Adventurer personality type are passionate experimenters, and whether they\u2019re aware of it or not, they are renowned trendsetters. With their unique perspective and simple desire to be themselves, Adventurers are natural artists, musicians and photographers, as well as designers of all stripes. Setting up shop on websites like Etsy is far more alluring to Adventurers than the confines of 9-5 administrative work in some fluorescent cubicle. Free Spirits at Work Adventurers loathe sitting idle in colorless, unchanging environments. They are free souls and need flexibility, opportunities for improvisation, and immersive work that engages every sense. If they combine these needs with their competitive nature, Adventurer personalities make great solo athletes. Adventurers prefer to live in the moment, believing the here and now is what matters most. This quality does have the drawback of sometimes making Adventurers reckless and shortsighted, though those pitfalls aren\u2019t set in stone. An emphasis on practical, tangible things, objects that can be seen and touched, comes at the cost of ignoring less tangible ideas. Adventurers often feel that they have little control over processes like retirement planning \u2013 they can\u2019t predict the future, so it does no good to worry about it now. Looking to Tomorrow This mindset can hold them back from many of their ideal careers, such as psychology, counseling and teaching, which require long-term planning and often extensive certifications to get started. It takes a great deal of energy for Adventurers to maintain focus on a single goal like that for so long, but it can make the day-to-day so much more rewarding for the rest of their lives. An easier route revolves around freelance and consulting work in just about any industry that Adventurers enjoy. Whether organizing charity events, working with hospitals to make patients\u2019 stays more pleasant, or laying stone to help make a house a home, Adventurers always seem to find a way to make the world a little more beautiful and exciting, and to make a living in the process."}]}

That\u2019s not to say that Logisticians can\u2019t do that sort of work \u2013 many find themselves thinking about what\u2019s on the other side of those cubical walls \u2013 but what they crave is dependability, and that is reflected in their choice of work perhaps more so than in any other part of their lives. A Steadfast Mind The facts support this, as the most common careers among people with the Logistician personality type revolve around institutions of respected tradition, authority, security, and established consistency. Careers as military officers, lawyers, judges, police officers and detectives are all very popular among Logisticians. This makes sense, as they not only offer the stability that Logisticians seek, but are in line with their principles and conservatism, establishing clear societal roles. Logisticians of course aren\u2019t limited to these organizations \u2013 there are many other roles that utilize their reliability, objectivity and sharp eyes. When facts and logic are out of place, Logistician personalities swoop in as the accountants, auditors, data analysts, financial managers, business administrators and even doctors that identify, report and correct the issues at hand. Most of these careers have Logisticians working alone, which is usually their preference, but when teams are necessary, they are best defined by clearly outlined roles, responsibilities and work environments. Nothing is quite so challenging for Logisticians as ongoing debates about who is responsible for what, resulting in work that\u2019s shoddily assembled \u2013 or worse, incomplete. Logisticians have strong opinions about how things should be done, and if things are shuffled too often, people with this personality type can become surprisingly vocal about their opposition. It\u2019s important for Logisticians to remember that even the most traditional and stable career paths can and need to change as time goes by. It is much better to accept this with grace than to develop reputations of being enemies of new ideas. The Backbone of Society Logisticians may also struggle with the increasingly open and social requirements of modern work life. Being somewhat bad at sensing others feelings, Logisticians\u2019 \u201cjust the facts\u201d attitude can be downright alienating when it comes to more sensitive personality types. This applies not just to coworkers but to customers as well \u2013 service positions like retail sales and waiting tables, as well as more emotionally demanding careers such as psychiatry are, generally speaking, a terrible fit. The ideal career paths feature a trend: they place facts above feelings and allow Logisticians to uphold the hard standards that are the backbone of society. Rules are the basis for everything people take for granted about modern life, from the social contract that smooths relationships, to the laws that protect peoples\u2019 most basic safety, to the constitutions and treaties that govern nations. People with the Logistician personality type take on roles as the defenders of these ideas, in big ways and small, and are rightfully proud of it."}]}

And with their creativity and drive, they can find ways to serve and uplift others in nearly any work environment, whether they\u2019re behind a gleaming table in a corporate boardroom or behind the counter at a beloved local coffee shop. People with the Protagonist personality type rarely want for inspiration or opportunity in their search for meaningful work. Earning Their Place Thanks to their emotional intelligence and social skills, Protagonists can excel in nearly any people-oriented field, such as human resources, event management, recruiting, or public relations. That said, they tend to feel especially motivated in positions where they can guide others to learn, grow, and become more independent. Many people with this personality type gravitate toward careers with an altruistic bent, such as social work, teaching, counseling, coaching, health care, or public interest law. Protagonists prove that a desire to serve others can be more than compatible with big ambitions. Rather than fading into the background, Protagonists are known for their leadership abilities, and they often find themselves in positions of influence. These personalities can be found in public office and at the helm of all sorts of organizations \u2013 from nonprofits and religious groups to scrappy start-ups and corporate empires. They may also find themselves in jobs as consultants, advisors, and managers. Wherever they work, Protagonists rarely lose sight of their core mission: to improve people\u2019s lives. They intuitively pick up on the needs of their clients or customers, and then they draw on their creativity to meet these needs in innovative, unexpected ways. As a result, these types are able to bring sincerity, integrity, and even idealism to jobs in sales, customer service, marketing, advertising, and product development. Finding the Deeper Issues Focused and driven, people with the Protagonist personality type are always up for a good challenge. That said, certain challenges motivate them more than others. Work that is repetitive, isolated, or otherwise constrained can be frustrating for them. Protagonists want to see the impact they\u2019re having, not to plug away at tasks all on their own. In their heart of hearts, Protagonists want to witness the positive effects of their work \u2013 to feel and experience the gratitude and appreciation of the people they\u2019ve helped. Protagonists feel fulfilled and energized by work that allows them to step back and reflect on the big picture. For these types, leaving a positive legacy is a key priority. This needn\u2019t mean something as grand as solving world hunger (although, knowing Protagonists, it certainly could). But most people with this personality type do use their professional energy to resolve at least some of the deeper issues that their customers or colleagues face. Versatile and insightful, Protagonists bring a wealth of strengths to their careers. At times, they may feel stuck or bored, wishing that their daily tasks could make more of an obvious difference in the world. But with their altruistic, creative spirits, these personalities almost inevitably find ways to use their work \u2013 whatever it might be \u2013 to contribute to the greater good."}]}

Few things feel more rewarding to a Campaigner parent than seeing their child light up with curiosity about the world around them. Parents with this personality type want their children to feel accepted and worthy just as they are. Rather than pressuring their children to look or act a certain way, Campaigners encourage their children\u2019s creativity and self-expression. Drawing on their own ingenuity and creativity, these parents guide their children to discover and embrace their unique passions and interests. Campaigners encourage their children\u2019s curiosity, sweeping away dolls and dinosaurs when interests shift to the ocean, then sweeping away the fish when tastes change again, to the stars. Balancing Love and Discipline Most Campaigner parents know the value of structure and predictability. That said, they might not have the heart (or, as they may see it, the lack of heart) to enforce rules and restrictions. These personalities often worry that if they\u2019re too strict or disciplinarian, they\u2019ll compromise the loving bond that they have with their children. With time, however, many Campaigners discover that having just enough structure can actually help their children thrive. Once they recognize this, these parents often learn to set guidelines in a way that\u2019s loving but firm. In this light, enforcing appropriate rules can become yet another way that Campaigners express just how much they love and care for their children. No matter how their children behave, Campaigner parents rarely lose touch with their open-minded and empathetic nature. Campaigners tend to radiate acceptance and compassion. As parents, they aim to become confidants their children can open up to without fear of judgment. People with this personality type excel at creating safe spaces where their children can feel comfortable talking about their frustrations and their fears, as well as their dearest hopes and dreams. Go On, Spread Your Wings Throughout their children\u2019s lives, Campaigners provide a combination of almost overwhelming love and support. But as children mature into adolescence, they naturally feel drawn to establish their independence. They may spend more time with their friends than with their family or experiment with views and ideas that are radically different from their parents\u2019. Campaigners often see their children\u2019s choices and behaviors as a referendum on their own parenting success. Although Campaigners love the idea of their children becoming independent, they may sometimes feel that their children are pushing them away \u2013 something that can be profoundly hurtful for these personalities. Campaigners may be free spirits, but they are also sensitive to others\u2019 feelings and expectations, and they may struggle not to take their children\u2019s behavior personally. Fortunately, Campaigners\u2019 compassion can help them understand and honor their children\u2019s needs through every stage of development. Parents with this personality type have the wonderful ability to meet their children exactly where they are. This can help their children develop a strong sense of self and self-worth, enabling them to venture confidently out into the big, wide world, knowing that they have both themselves and their Campaigner parent to depend on."}]}

But even as they find their own way through the world, these personalities feel called to help other people embark on their own journeys toward meaning, fulfillment, and happiness. In their understated, nondomineering way, Mediators love guiding others to learn and grow \u2013 and parenthood can be an incredibly rewarding opportunity for them to do exactly that. From the start, Mediator parents aim to be warm, caring, and open-minded. People with this personality type delight in their children\u2019s wide-eyed wonder at the world, and they want to give their children freedom \u2013 freedom to form their own opinions, discover their own interests, and grow into their unique selves. Mediator parents counterbalance these freedoms by creating a stable foundation of support and acceptance, in hopes that their children never forget just how much they are loved. Sensitive and perceptive, Mediators attune themselves to their children\u2019s needs and perspectives. They want to know their children as unique, multidimensional individuals rather than as projections of themselves. Coping with Challenges Mediators may enjoy raising free spirits, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re totally hands-off. They want to teach key values to their children, including honesty, compassion, and the importance of caring for others. They also want their children to understand the meaning of personal responsibility, especially when it comes to not hurting others. Like parents of any personality type, Mediator parents inevitably face challenges. They take their parenting responsibilities seriously, so it can feel like a personal failure when their children misbehave in ways both large and small. These personalities may be especially upset when they see their children behaving in ways that don\u2019t seem considerate or ethical. With their hyperactive consciences, Mediators may blame themselves for their children\u2019s misbehavior, even when doing so isn\u2019t reasonable or productive. When their children do something wrong, Mediators may find themselves wondering, Have I failed as a parent? The danger here is that people with this personality type might become so focused on blaming themselves that they don\u2019t establish appropriate consequences for their children\u2019s actions. Discipline may not come easily to Mediators, but when balanced with their caring, gentle natures, it can become a powerful tool in their mission to teach their children the difference between right and wrong. Balancing Structure with Spontaneity Mediator parents naturally want to serve as good role models. They try to show their children the best side of themselves, keeping their problems, negative emotions, and frustrations under wraps. This can preserve a sense of harmony in the household, helping their children feel safe and cared for. By the same token, Mediators often try to shield their children from the greater problems in the world. This is certainly appropriate when their children are young, but eventually, Mediators need to find ways to talk through tougher issues with their kids. Another hurdle for many parents with this personality type is establishing practical, day-to-day structures and rules for their children. Fortunately, Mediators can use their creative energy to impose boundaries without stifling their children\u2019s curiosity and enthusiasm. These parents have a remarkable ability to put themselves in other people\u2019s shoes, and this enables them to come up with schedules and rules that truly work for their children\u2019s individual needs. When they balance structure with spontaneity, Mediators can help their children grow into their most caring, responsible, and joyful selves. And that is exactly what these parents strive for \u2013 to raise children who recognize their unique gifts and talents and share them with the world."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ESTJ's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "With their trademark responsibility, work ethic, ambition, and leadership, Assertive Executives (ESTJ-A) and Turbulent Executives (ESTJ-T) share a very dynamic path through life. Because of the nature of their core traits, where Identity might split other personality types, Executives can look very similar. This similarity is likely due to their shared sense of dedication and drive. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that they are untouched by Identity differences. Let\u2019s explore further to see how those differences play out, specifically in their emotional and social interactions. Passionate Thinkers 75% of Turbulent Executives agreed that some people around them would say their emotional reactions can be intense, compared to 45% of Assertive Executives. We see a lot of Executive Identity differences playing out in their emotions. But that doesn\u2019t mean that either type of Executive is highly emotional. It\u2019s helpful to remember this as we explore the Assertive and Turbulent personality differences. That said, when compared to other Sentinels , both types of Executive describe themselves in ways that suggest that they are passionate about their goals and accomplishments. And both types of Executive will likely stand their ground when the defense of their achievements and goals seems needed. These personality types are the Sentinels who are least afraid of conflict. Turbulent Executives take this up a notch. They guard all the things they\u2019re responsible for energetically. In defending them, they can become angry and even aggressive. When compared to Assertive Executives, Turbulent Executives describe themselves as more emotionally reactive. It\u2019s likely that when typical Executive ambition meets Turbulent doubt, Turbulent Executive personalities are more likely to engage in defensive thinking and behavior. They may do so in the name of protecting their gains or goals. Turbulent Executives are more likely than their Assertive counterparts to say they are easily provoked and to meet aggression with aggression. That probably comes across as toughness. But, in reality, it may be a more fragile defensiveness. 84% of Turbulent Executives said they\u2019re easily angered when they feel slighted or offended, compared to 48% of Assertive Executives. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that Turbulent Executives pass through life always angry by any means. Turbulent Executives are likely to moderate their emotions for practical and rational reasons. Being too upset too often is not suitable for personal or professional relationships, which are valuable to them. When viewed in an overarching way, these personalities are more likely to look for a rational approach when interacting with others rather than an emotional one. Assertive Executives have some of these same protective qualities, but they aren\u2019t as likely to take a defensive stance quite as quickly. They are more likely to believe that they can easily handle any threats they sense or imagine, and so are more easygoing when responding to such things. They are less likely to dwell on problems or the past, which might suggest that these personalities let go of slights and find forgiveness more easily. But their relaxed nature may also be interpreted as apathy by others who do not know them well. The Role Others Play 78% of Assertive Executives said their happiness does not depend on how other people feel about them, compared to 44% of Turbulent Executives. Similarly, Assertive Executives say they don\u2019t need approval to be happy. Assertive individuals tend to think in more independent terms. When this independence is combined with the Thinking personality trait, these Executives are a little more likely than Turbulent Executives to keep others at a distance. That\u2019s not to say Assertive Executives are incapable of deep relationships, but such connections may not be as urgent for these personality types. Assertive Executives are still Extraverts even if they have less of a need for others than Turbulent Executives. Their Extraversion limits their Assertive pursuit of independence much more than it might if they were Introverts. Turbulent Executives are much more responsive to others and profess a stronger need for the people in their lives. Even eating alone in a restaurant is more uncomfortable for them than for Assertive Executives. People seem essential for their happiness and comfort. An elevated need for people can be a real benefit to Turbulent Executives, making them more open to opinions and ideas as a way to preserve respectful relationships. This openness may even nudge Turbulent Executives toward being more sensitive to the needs and feelings of the people who populate their various social and professional circles. 63% of Turbulent Executives agreed that their behavior is often dictated by what others around them are doing, compared to 36% of Assertive Executives. Turbulent Executives may try to \u201cfit in\u201d to satisfy these needs for others. In many situations, that alone is not a problem. As the saying goes, \u201cWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do.\u201d Conforming can be a way to connect with others. It only becomes a problem when it goes too far, and these Executives abandon that which makes them who they are. These personalities may also find themselves people-pleasing and trying not to upset others. This walking on eggshells is yet another reason they are likely to moderate \u2013 or perhaps repress \u2013 any negative emotions they might feel. Assertive Executives are less interested in conforming. Their self-assurance and their sense of purpose offer them a perspective that allows these personalities to place less value on how others see them. But again, their level of attention to such things is relative. As Extraverts, Assertive Executives are likely to want mutual respect or even shared admiration, if for no other reason than to keep their social connections healthy. But they are less interested than Turbulent Executives in being popular. Connecting with others likely comes from a place of \u201cwant\u201d for them, rather than \u201cneed.\u201d 70% of Turbulent Executives said they often worry that they might have let someone down, compared to 36% of Assertive Executives. Both types of Executive are likely to sacrifice to benefit any group with whom they are involved. Such sacrifice is likely a product of their disciplined nature and their drive to succeed. However, there is a glaring difference here between Assertive and Turbulent Executives. Turbulent Executives report succumbing to pressure much more than Assertive Executives do. Consequently, Turbulent Executives\u2019 sacrifice may feel coerced. Turbulent Executives are more likely to report getting a lot of pressure from their families to succeed. These personalities are more likely than Assertive Executives to say they feel uncomfortable doing something socially unacceptable, even if no one sees them do it. So, even without actual eyes on them, they still feel social pressure. Such pressure may sound like a negative. But, in the right measure, it can also provide a type of accountability that drives Turbulent Executives toward even more diligent behavior. However, if excessive, such pressure can also play on their self-doubt and create anxiety that paralyzes their efforts. 70% of Assertive Executives said it does not bother them if someone really dislikes them, compared to 39% of Turbulent Executives. Assertive Executives appear to be comparatively immune to the pressure others try to place on them. They have less need for the approval of others or to be liked on any level. Because of this, they tend to be more independent and to travel more lightly and somewhat more swiftly through life because they don\u2019t depend so much on the counsel of others. Again, a grain of salt must be taken. They are still Extraverts and still get energy from people. They aren\u2019t likely to crave solitude. But they probably avoid the opinions of others becoming a burden as much as is possible while still maintaining relationships. Summary Assertive Executives are more likely than Turbulent Executives to consider themselves very purposeful people. However, on closer inspection, both personality types have strong focus and are goal-oriented. Turbulent Executives tend to be more emotionally reactive and more easily angered. This is likely born of a more defensive stance rather than an aggressive one. Assertive Executives are more easygoing when it comes to emotions. This can make them appear less sensitive and unconcerned. But it likely also makes them quicker to forgive. As Extraverts, both types of Executives want people in their lives. However, Turbulent Executives experience a bit more of a need for this than Assertive Executives do. Turbulent Executives feel a higher pressure to conform. This pressure can make these personalities more sensitive to the needs of others. Assertive Executives are likely to desire companionship more than need it. Viewing social interaction as a pleasurable option allows them to enjoy the people in their lives while also maintaining their more efficient, independent decisiveness. Whether they\u2019re Assertive or Turbulent, Executives are ambitious and diligent in all the things they see as important. Introduce the Identity personality traits, and they become less alike while keeping their shared core traits. We see their differences expressed mostly in their emotional and social lives, and this boils down to how they regard and relate to others. Since both personality types are Extraverts, people remain essential to them and provide energy in their lives. But it doesn\u2019t always look the same, depending on whether Executives possess the Assertive or Turbulent Identity."}]}

It is not always easy to be Commanders\u2019 friends \u2013 they demand a lot from these relationships \u2013 but they pay a great deal of attention to their friendships, and it is unlikely that it will ever feel stagnant. Commander friendships are built on ideas, and a lot of what they find enjoyable is the repartee of putting thoughts forward and defending them from assault from every angle. People with the Commander personality type are very smart and highly critical, and they won\u2019t back down if they are put on the defensive \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s no better way to earn their respect. It\u2019s not easy to stand up to a personality as big and blustery as Commanders\u2019, and they too often find that others crumple under the force they apply when they really start to enjoy themselves. Only the most hardened rationalists are able to hold their ground against strongly expressed Commander personalities, who neither need emotional support, nor understand others\u2019 need for it. This lack of sensitivity is Commanders\u2019 chiefest weakness. Their tendency to challenge their friends, question their conclusions, and dismiss emotional arguments as irrelevant is especially difficult for Feeling-oriented friends to cope with. Either a point is supported by logic and reason, or it is erroneous. Bridging the Gap More enlightened Commanders recognize that if ever there was an area where they could learn from others and improve themselves, it is in the realm of emotional sensitivity \u2013 to dismiss any aspect of personal growth borders on hypocrisy. Friendships with people from the Diplomat type group can be especially rewarding for Commanders, as the shared Intuitive (N) trait fosters an instantaneous connection that can bridge the chasm between their uninhibited logic and the recognition that cooperation and conciliation can often accomplish more than that logic ever could alone. Still, the bulk of Commanders\u2019 friends will likely fall into the Analyst category, as all of these types share the same passion for logical, far-reaching ideas and critical debate. Anyone who can match Commanders\u2019 ability to brainstorm and theorize will find an honest and dedicated friend. Anyone who can\u2019t or won\u2019t, as with many more down-to-earth types who often question the point of such discussions, will find themselves ignored \u2013 perhaps a situation that is best for everyone."}]}

Curious \u2013 Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research needs to move forward \u2013 if Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so. Artistic \u2013 Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience. Adventurer Weaknesses Fiercely Independent \u2013 Freedom of expression is often Adventurers\u2019 top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and work a challenge. Unpredictable \u2013 Adventurers\u2019 dislike long-term commitments and plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause strain in Adventurers\u2019 romantic relationships and financial hardship later in life. Easily Stressed \u2013 Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth. Overly Competitive \u2013 Adventurers can escalate small things into intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose. Fluctuating Self-Esteem \u2013 It\u2019s demanded that skills be quantified, but that\u2019s hard to do with Adventurers\u2019 strengths of sensitivity and artistry. Adventurers\u2019 efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to believe the naysayers without strong support."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "INTP's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Due to their four shared Logician traits, Assertive Logicians (INTP-A) and Turbulent Logicians (INTP-T) are more alike than different compared to any other types. But their Identities add some nuance to the similarities, creating two subtypes within the personality type. To review the defining qualities of the Identities, we invite you to explore them more fully in our Framework section. 77% of Assertive Logicians say they are comfortable with themselves, compared to 36% of Turbulent Logicians. \u201cOptimist or Pessimist?\u201d Survey Assertive Logicians are more likely to be satisfied with their current place in life when compared to Turbulent Logicians. But this is a standard difference between all Assertive and Turbulent personalities. Types are likely to overlap some when expressing identities. In typical fashion, Assertive Logicians report being more comfortable in their skins than Turbulent Logicians. However, that\u2019s a matter of degree since our research shows both Logician types are more likely to feel less satisfied with their lives than the average person. 73% of Assertive Logicians say they are proud of who they are as a person, compared to 42% of Turbulent Logicians. \u201cPride\u201d Survey But there are two areas where Logician personalities express their Identities in somewhat more distinct ways due to their other characteristics: how they deal with change and how they deal with people. Consistency and Change Assertive Both Assertive and Turbulent Logicians, influenced by the Prospecting personality trait as it interacts with their Intuitive and Thinking traits, are prone to change directions (or their methods) often. They rarely become so set on one concept they stop considering all other possibilities. In its purest form, this can lead to serial, impulsive obsessions that burn hot one day, only to cool when something else of interest appears on their radar. The result can be a state of constant flux. 27% of Assertive Logicians say they often make decisions they know they\u2019ll regret, compared to 54% of Turbulent Logicians. \u201cRegret: General Attitudes\u201d Survey But, on closer inspection, these two types of Logicians have a different relationship to change and their more impulsive responses to information. Assertive Logicians have a slightly greater tendency to look before they leap. In addition, their confidence allows these personalities to be surer when they pick a direction and less likely to question their commitment to it. This subtle commitment can make Assertive Logicians\u2019 behaviors and ideas a shade more consistent than those of their Turbulent counterparts. If they\u2019re confident in their direction, there\u2019s little need to change it. This doesn\u2019t negate their Prospecting flexibility. It just regulates it to a degree \u2013 and creates a significant distinction between them and Turbulent Logicians. On the other hand, these personalities aren\u2019t bothered by change, either, and tend to go with the flow. 87% of Assertive Logicians say they are confident when they deal with day-to-day activities, compared to 59% of Turbulent Logicians. \u201cHandling Stress\u201d Survey Turbulent One of the defining qualities of the Turbulent personality trait is a pronounced drive to change and improve in order to repair perceived deficiencies. Turbulent Logicians are no different. But for this Thinking/Prospecting type, with every new piece of knowledge, there is the potential that it acts as a compass \u2013 sending them off in a new direction on a quest for something better, something to improve. The basic qualities of the imaginative growth-seeking Logician amplify this aspect of the Turbulent trait. 28% of Turbulent Logicians are satisfied with what they have achieved so far in their life, compared to 45% of Assertive Logicians. \u201cHappiness and Life Satisfaction\u201d Survey However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Turbulent Logicians will follow through on all their ideas. Sometimes, their relative lack of confidence might stifle any action. Or, sometimes, the whole thing is just an Introverted mental exercise, and the process remains internal and forever hidden. Even when these personalities flirt with change, they may not always be comfortable with it. They typically prefer their own ideas to those initiated by someone else or one that catches them by surprise. 66% of Turbulent Logicians say they become stressed out when there are last-minute changes, compared to 35% of Assertive Logicians. \u201cNeed for Drama\u201d Survey When Turbulent Logicians choose to share their thoughts, it may be hard for others to keep up with the ongoing changes in their thinking and their goals. Their shifting objectives can become moving targets in the eyes of other personality types \u2013 particularly those with the Judging trait \u2013 leaving Turbulent Logicians with the reputation of never being able to commit solidly to a plan. Logicians and Other People Assertive Assertive Logicians are more likely than all other personality types to say they rarely let people upset them. They are also less likely than Turbulent Logicians to hold a grudge after an argument. Not being driven by the opinions of others is one hallmark of the Assertive Identity. These Logicians may frequently act without the permission or approval of others. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission\u201d might be their occasional motto. This allows these personalities to advance their goals in life in an independent and perhaps a more streamlined fashion. Only 27% of Assertive Logicians say they get angry easily, compared to 60% of Turbulent Logicians. \u201cAnger Management\u201d Survey But this can also be problematic. It can lead to Assertive Logicians appearing arrogant or as though they\u2019re acting in condescending ways. Their Introverted, Intuitive, and Thinking traits already lend these personalities an air of remoteness that can feed this perception. But rather than arrogance, it may sometimes mean that they believe so much in their own strategies and ideas that they are unable to see room for anyone else\u2019s contributions. Where collaboration or a team effort is called for, it may be difficult for them to fit in. 42% of Assertive Logicians consider themselves \u201cvery intelligent\u201d, compared to 23% of Turbulent Logicians. \u201cIntelligence\u201d Survey Turbulent 51% of Turbulent Logicians say they feel envy when a friend accomplishes a goal, compared to 24% of Assertive Logicians. \u201cJealousy and Envy\u201d Survey Turbulent Logicians are comparatively more influenced by the opinions of others, and even their appearance seems to matter more to them. These personalities are more likely to value staying fit as a means of maintaining self-confidence than their Assertive counterparts. They are also likely to feel more self-conscious because of their appearance. This suggests they feel a greater need to impress others. The opinions of their friends typically inform Turbulent Logicians\u2019 levels of confidence to a far greater extent compared to the Assertive Logicians. Turbulent Logicians are also much more likely to be upset if someone they like doesn\u2019t like them back. This need for approval can cause people with this personality type to question anything that doesn\u2019t receive a resounding endorsement from those around them. 85% of Turbulent Logicians say it takes a while for them to forgive themselves when they make a mistake in front of a friend, compared to 55% of Assertive Logicians. \u201cHandling Stress\u201d Survey But needing approval can be helpful or problematic, depending on how and where Turbulent Logicians express it and to what degree others influence their decisions. If not carried to excess, this can work for Turbulent Logicians, giving them an edge over Assertive Logicians when it comes to connecting with others. But always having to check with others for approval can make it harder for Turbulent Logicians to move forward. Each issue raised might elicit differing opinions from each of their friends or colleagues. Trying to please everybody can be paralyzing. In Summary Assertive Logicians are likely to be more consistent than Turbulent Logicians due to confidence in the choices they make and being less influenced by others. Turbulent Logicians change their goals more often than their Assertive cousins. This can make these personalities more flexible problem-solvers \u2013 though perhaps too flexible at times. Assertive Logicians, being less moved by the opinions of others, are often endowed with the advantages of more independent and streamlined thought and action. However, this may also result in Assertive Logicians putting more distance between them and the people in their lives. Turbulent Logicians are more influenced by the opinions and approval of those in their lives. This can make people with this personality type more open and accessible to their friends, families, or coworkers. Turbulent Logicians who depend too much on the opinions of others may find they freeze in place waiting for approval. Or, to the contrary, they may give up and move on, abandoning a potentially good idea.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in Psychology and Personalities, especially about MBTI personality types. You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ISTJ's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Logisticians are typically practical and reliable people. Most individuals who share this personality type value consistency and honesty. However, introduce the Identities , and we see differences in how Assertive Logisticians (ISTJ-A) and Turbulent Logisticians (ISTJ-T) express those values. The values don\u2019t change \u2013 just the expression of them. Let\u2019s explore some ways these personalities reveal their differences in their unique Logistician way. Dealing with the Unexpected Stability is important to all Logisticians, but Turbulent Logisticians also need to find consistency in their lives. It provides them a greater sense of security and safety. They crave feeling settled in, but they can struggle to reach this state because of their perfectionistic tendencies. Things may rarely seem good enough to them, and they may have difficulty experiencing satisfaction. A sense of satisfaction is the hallmark of the Assertive Identity regardless of personality type. This doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a passive sort of contentment, but a positive hum is always in the background of their lives. Assertive Logisticians are no different. This applies both to how they feel about themselves and to whatever situations in which they may find themselves. This results in Assertive Logisticians having a level of comfort that many Turbulent Logisticians may find hard to get hold of for themselves. 63% of Assertive Logisticians say they always know exactly what they want, compared to 27% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cPLANNING\u201d SURVEY Both types of Logisticians prefer planned lives with certain outcomes, due to the influence of their Judging personality trait. But this may be a more problematic area for Turbulent Logisticians, who can be unsure enough of themselves to create indecision. It\u2019s hard to value certainty and yet not be able to land easily on a firm goal. Logistician personality types aren\u2019t known for their flexibility. But the positive side of Turbulent Logisticians\u2019 indecisiveness is that it may help them bend a little more than their Assertive cousins when change is needed. Turbulent Logisticians constantly focus on improvement. Combine that with the idea that they may not be as decisively committed to a single idea (whereas Assertive Logisticians may picture a very specific target), and we have a more flexible variation of Logistician. This, however, doesn\u2019t mean that Turbulent Logisticians suddenly go against type or that they are flexible because they are Turbulent. Our focus here is comparing the Assertive to the Turbulent. Turbulent Logisticians are likely more flexible than Assertive Logisticians, who are surer of where they think they should be going and satisfied enough with life that the idea of change is not as urgent nor ever-present. 72% of Assertive Logisticians say their expectations are based on what they think will happen rather than what they want to happen, compared to 46% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cEXPECTATIONS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Logisticians say they base their expectations on what they believe will happen rather than what they want their future to look like. Since they tend to believe that their expectations line up with future reality rather than their own desires, these personalities may claim a more objective viewpoint. Greater confidence can inspire a greater sense of being right about outcomes, and Assertive Logisticians are likely to also attach this Assertive feature to their predictions. 52% of Assertive Logisticians rate themselves as either highly or very highly confident, compared to 17% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cSELF-CONFIDENCE\u201d SURVEY Both personality variants tend to see clear expectations as being necessary for successful results. But more Turbulent Logisticians than Assertive ones say they set high standards when engaging in a new experience. Additionally, a slight majority (54%) of Turbulent Logisticians describe their expectations as being based on what they want to happen rather than what they think is likely to happen. 71% of Assertive Logisticians feel satisfied with what they have achieved so far in life, compared to 41% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cHAPPINESS AND LIFE SATISFACTION\u201d SURVEY Disappointment based on expectations might indicate the potential for a mild drift among Turbulent Logisticians toward feeling let down by life. Their view of the world may default to what they want not being the same as what they get. Research indicates that these personalities also worry more about their expectations. This way of thinking may partially add to the reasons why Turbulent Logisticians describe a lower sense of satisfaction when measured against their Assertive counterparts. Self, Others, and Identity Differences 72% of Assertive Logisticians say they would pursue an important personal goal even if it hurt the feelings of people close to them, compared to 52% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cRELYING ON OTHERS\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Logisticians are more likely to care about what others think about them and typically work harder to maintain their relationships. Assertive Logisticians are likely less interested in opinions other than their own and will focus more on pursuing their paths somewhat more independently. Relationships have less of a pull on where that path might go. This can also streamline their activities. A person often advances more quickly if they feel they don\u2019t need to take the time to consult with others. 81% of Assertive Logisticians say they\u2019re happy with the way they look, compared to 33% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cBODY IMAGE\u201d SURVEY Body image may seem superficial and insignificant. But how one feels about their appearance can influence \u2013 and even be a metaphor for \u2013 other aspects of how one feels about their life. Interestingly, body image is one of the areas with the largest statistical differences between the two Logistician personality variants. Not surprisingly, far fewer Turbulent Logisticians than Assertive ones say they are happy with their looks. More Turbulent Logisticians also report that they often worry about their appearance. Appearance primarily involves one\u2019s exterior and what other people see. Since Turbulent Logisticians are more likely to value the opinions of others, not feeling good about the way they look can contribute to how they feel about themselves generally. They are also more likely to say their mood is determined by the way they think they look. Poor body image can be the product of lower self-confidence \u2013 and, in reverse, negative body image can contribute to low self-confidence. 48% of Assertive Logisticians say they are very rarely offended by others, compared to 19% of Turbulent Logisticians. \u201cBEING OFFENDED\u201d SURVEY Neither variant has a majority saying they are often offended by others. However, relatively speaking, Turbulent Logisticians may be more focused on the opinions of others, and they are somewhat more reactive. Another way to look at this is that these personalities are also more responsive. While it would be extreme to paint Assertive Logisticians as uncaring, their Turbulent counterparts are somewhat more aware of what others are doing and are more likely to act on it. Expressing Emotions Differently Logisticians don\u2019t easily admit their feelings even to themselves, and as a group, they rarely talk about them. But Turbulent Logisticians tend to face their emotions more freely when measured against Assertive Logisticians. They are also likely to reveal how they are feeling to others more often. This difference can influence how other people view them. 57% of Turbulent Logisticians say they get angry more easily than most people, compared to 30% of Assertive Logisticians. \u201cANGER MANAGEMENT\u201d SURVEY Their more reserved emotions can make Assertive Logisticians come across as aloof. This may displace their aura of calm confidence more than they like. These personalities generally enjoy cooperative relationships, but their cooler approach may make that slightly harder, depending on who they team up with. Turbulent Logisticians who are more open with their feelings are more likely to come across as accessible. But this is true only if they express their emotions effectively. Maintaining balance is essential. In Summary Unexpected changes bother Logisticians more than any other personality type, and this is especially true for Turbulent Logisticians. However, in their ongoing need to improve and with their sense of uncertainty, they may actually be more willing to change, despite a certain amount of distress, than the more settled Assertive Logisticians. Assertive Logisticians are the least impulsive personality type, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are the least flexible (see the above bullet point). Assertive Logisticians are likely much happier than Turbulent Logisticians with the way they look. Because of the value Turbulent personalities place on the opinions of others, this can affect much in the life of the Turbulent Logistician. Turbulent Logisticians are more emotionally reactive and are more likely to express and act on their emotions than Assertive personality types. The positive side of their more expressive emotions is that they can make them more accessible to others. Assertive Logisticians are less likely to be interested in what others think and are less likely to be open about their feelings. Not waiting for the opinions of others can make moving forward easier for these Logisticians. Shared Foundations It\u2019s important to remember that one Identity trait, either Assertive or Turbulent, is not better than the other. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. Knowing what these differences are, and knowing how they are likely expressed in individual Logisticians, can be useful. But despite their nuanced differences, both types of Logisticians are likely to remain stabilizing forces in society."}]}

They often follow their own path with healthy self-regard and relatively minimal concern for traditional structures. However, the Assertive and Turbulent Identity traits can affect how these personality types see themselves and respond to everything around them. Let\u2019s look at some of the differences between how Assertive Virtuosos (ISTP-A) and Turbulent Virtuosos (ISTP-T) are likely to express their personality traits . Curiosity, Confidence, and Doubt Virtuosos rarely hesitate to dive in when engaging in a task, but their respective Identity traits can give these personalities a different initial perspective. Assertive Virtuosos generally show more confidence in their knowledge than Turbulent Virtuosos. Both types depend on their ingenuity, but Assertive Virtuosos often have a clearer, firmer vision of their intended approach to something. 80% of Assertive Virtuosos say they are usually confident that they know the best way to do something, compared to 52% of Turbulent Virtuosos. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST\u201d SURVEY Curiosity and personal interest also strongly motivate these personality types to engage in projects, practices, and pursuits. Most Virtuosos tend to consider their hobbies to be a significant part of who they are, but compared to Assertive variants, Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely to seek new ones frequently. These types\u2019 curiosity is often a bit more restless in nature. 66% of Turbulent Virtuosos say they are always looking for new hobbies to get into, compared to 49% of Assertive Virtuosos. \u201cHOBBIES\u201d SURVEY When it comes to apprehension about trying things, the two Identities differ notably. Assertive Virtuosos are less likely to engage in reflexive risk assessment, their sense of confidence helping them remain focused on the moment. They\u2019re far less likely than their Turbulent counterparts to go through a lot of mental what-ifs when preparing to engage in an activity. The shared, core personality\u00a0traits of all Virtuosos make them relatively adaptable, but Assertive Virtuosos are more likely to maintain a steady sense of their own capabilities. Only 43% of Assertive Virtuosos say they instinctively consider the worst-case scenario before participating in an activity, compared to 72% of Turbulent Virtuosos. \u201cFEAR\u201d SURVEY Virtuosos flexibly approach challenges and opportunities alike, but Identity often affects how they view results. Recovering from failure is one such area, with Turbulent Virtuosos far more likely than their Assertive counterparts to doubt themselves following a mistake. For a personality type that values their independent abilities, the Turbulent trait can inflate the impact of having failed. 77% of Turbulent Virtuosos say that if they make a mistake, they tend to start doubting themselves, their abilities, or their knowledge instead of brushing it off, compared to 23% of Assertive Virtuosos. \u201cDOUBTS\u201d SURVEY Relating to Others Virtuosos are among the least social of all personality types, with\u00a0mastery of personal skills\u00a0occupying much of their focus, time, and energy. Yet these personality types feel normal social pressures like anyone else, and their Identity colors their responses. When it comes to fitting in with others, even in important situations, Assertive Virtuosos are less likely to worry than their Turbulent counterparts. This is not necessarily because they\u2019re more certain that they\u2019ll integrate harmoniously\u00a0\u2013\u00a0often, it\u2019s\u00a0because they simply aren\u2019t as troubled if they don\u2019t. 39% of Assertive Virtuosos say they\u2019ve worried about fitting in at a new workplace, compared to 77% of Turbulent Virtuosos. \u201cSOCIAL PRESSURES\u201d SURVEY Identity traits also influence how these types see themselves relative to others. Though Virtuosos are possibly the most independent-minded of the personality types, Turbulent Virtuosos are far more likely than Assertive Virtuosos\u00a0to compare themselves to others. This isn\u2019t primarily driven by a desire for social inclusion.\u00a0It\u2019s\u00a0often more about evaluating themselves and establishing self-worth. 81% of Turbulent Virtuosos say they consciously compare themselves to others often or very often, compared to 21% of Assertive Virtuosos. \u201cSOCIAL COMPARISON\u201d SURVEY Dealing with Stress and Negative Thoughts Assertive Virtuosos usually find it easier than their Turbulent counterparts to maintain motivation and a steady mind-set when life\u2019s pressures mount. They are more likely than Turbulent Virtuosos to feel that\u00a0they are in control, even when things seem to be going wrong all around them. This durability doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that\u00a0Assertive Virtuosos will perform tasks better under stress, but they\u2019re likely to feel better and remain more focused. Only 24% of Assertive Virtuosos\u00a0feel like they\u2019re often overwhelmed by life, compared to 75% of Turbulent Virtuosos. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Identity also plays a big part in how Virtuosos are likely to respond internally to stress or other strong feelings. Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely than Assertive Virtuosos to report that they get flustered easily. They\u2019re less likely to maintain self-control in general, as their emotions become\u00a0more chaotic during both highs and lows. 37% of Turbulent Virtuosos\u00a0feel like they have control over their emotions, compared to 81% of Assertive Virtuosos. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY While normally relatively detached and rational, Virtuoso personalities can become upset in certain circumstances, as anyone might. And when their emotions turn to anger, Assertive Virtuosos have an easier time dealing with their feelings than their Turbulent cousins. Their sense of emotional control enables them to be less reactive to anger, and their anger isn\u2019t likely to last as long. 85% of Assertive Virtuosos say it usually takes less than one hour or only a few minutes\u00a0for their anger to subside, compared to 55% of Turbulent Virtuosos. \u201cANGER MANAGEMENT\u201d SURVEY In broad terms, Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely to feel any form of agitation. Unfortunately, this can even extend to how they see themselves. Whether it\u2019s their body image, sense of self-confidence, or optimism about their future, it\u2019s somewhat harder for these personality types to feel secure than it is for Assertive Virtuosos. 55% of Turbulent Virtuosos say they feel comfortable with themselves, compared to 78% of Assertive Virtuosos. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST\u201d SURVEY However, a desire to feel better about themselves can provide Turbulent Virtuosos with a form of motivation that differs from the greater confidence of their Assertive cousins. Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely to feel compelled to prove themselves in order to address any discomfort with who they are. This can give them drive in life, and these personalities are more likely than Assertive Virtuosos to believe that their ambition will lead to accomplishment. 85% of Turbulent Virtuosos say they have a strong desire to be an important and successful person, compared to 48% of Assertive Virtuosos. \u201cAMBITION\u201d SURVEY Summary Assertive Virtuosos are more likely to be confident that they know the best way to do something. Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely to seek new hobbies often. Assertive Virtuosos are less likely to consider the worst-case scenario when engaging in an activity. Turbulent Virtuosos are much more likely to start doubting themselves, their abilities, or their knowledge if they make a mistake. Assertive Virtuosos are notably less likely to compare themselves to others \u2013 or worry about fitting in with them. Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely to feel overwhelmed by life or when things go wrong. Assertive Virtuosos are much more likely to feel they have control over their emotions, and their anger typically fades faster. Turbulent Virtuosos are somewhat less likely to feel comfortable with most aspects of themselves. Relative to Assertive personality\u00a0variants, Turbulent Virtuosos are more likely to feel ambitious and believe that it will lead to success. Conclusions Virtuosos have many common behaviors, though it\u2019s clear that\u00a0Identity can make a difference in how these types express their personality traits. It isn\u2019t so much that they do different things, but that they do similar things differently and experience certain feelings with varying intensity. It\u2019s important to note that while Turbulent Virtuosos may struggle with more unsettled emotions, they can match their Assertive counterparts when it comes to applying their skills and succeeding in life."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ENTJ's Workplace habits"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Workplace Habits For people with the Commander personality type, the workplace is all but a natural habitat. Commanders\u2019 efficiency and clear communication are valued, their leadership is admired, and their ability to simply get things done is unrivaled. That being said, some situations are more appropriate for Commanders than others \u2013 these qualities all point to a managerial or executive role, making any position of comparative powerlessness highly undesirable. Commander personality types are strident ones though, able to adapt themselves to just about any hierarchical relationship by doing what they do best: asserting their opinions, taking the initiative, and accomplishing feats that others thought impossible. Commander Subordinates Subordinate positions are challenging for Commanders, and it takes active management to ensure their satisfaction and engagement. Ever the high achievers, Commander subordinates set out to learn new skills and to seek out new challenges and responsibilities, eager to prove that nothing is impossible with a little hard work. If things get a little slow, Commander personalities may slip into periods of absentmindedness, but when they feel involved in the projects around them, they prove well organized and well prioritized. Commanders hold themselves to very high standards, but a lot of what sets this tone is feedback from their environment \u2013 namely, criticism from their managers. Objective, rational statements about what is done right and what can be done better are helpful to Commanders, and far from resenting such criticisms, they appreciate them. Opportunities for growth keep people with the Commander personality type engaged and productive, and so long as their managers recognize this as their primary responsibility, it will be a fruitful and satisfying relationship. Commander Colleagues Among colleagues, Commanders are sociable and greatly enjoy sharing ideas and critiques in their frequent brainstorming sessions. Natural leaders that they are, Commanders tend to assert themselves into positions as representatives and project leads, considering their objectivity and charisma the perfect qualities for these roles. Commander personalities enjoy working with equals, but people must demonstrate that they are equals \u2013 anyone Commanders view as being less competent or driven will see only condescension and arrogance. Commanders are strong-willed, even dominant, and though they enjoy inspiring and tutoring others, the energy they bring to the process can seem overbearing. When these roles are reversed, Commanders\u2019 mentors should bear in mind that their students are very rational and respect firm confidence \u2013 hand-holding, emotional appeals or wavering indecision will likely burn the bridge then and there. In a partnership, what is best is what is most effective, and time wasted sugarcoating reality is just that \u2013 time wasted. Commander Managers Commander managers are confident, charismatic communicators, and they communicate but one vision: to get the job done as efficiently as possible, and to the highest standard of quality. All else is subordinate to that objective, but the means by which Commanders achieve it cause others to adopt this cause as their own. Commanders are natural leaders, and their ability to formulate a strategy and to identify the strengths of each member of their teams, incorporating those abilities into their plans so that each individual fills a unique and important role, makes them able motivators. But while these efforts boost morale and satisfaction among Commanders\u2019 likeminded subordinates, they are still crafted to achieve that ultimate goal of timely and exceptional work. Those seen as inefficient by their Commander managers, or who demonstrate themselves to be lazy or to produce shoddy work will know in no uncertain terms of their failure to impress. The only way to recover is to comply, the only alternative is to find a new manager to impress, somewhere else."}]}

They are often the unseen backbone of many a venture. But Identity differences sort each personality type into two subtypes and guide how they express their tendencies. A Caring Mind-Set, With or Without the Worry 87% of Turbulent Defenders say they usually blame themselves first when something goes wrong, compared to 55% of Assertive Defenders. \u201cTHOUGHT PATTERNS\u201d SURVEY Defenders tend to be sensitively perceptive individuals with an eye for details. They\u2019re likely to spot when distress engulfs someone \u2013 or when something is amiss on a practical level \u2013 much quicker than most other personality types. Much about their caring nature emerges from this. Their mind-set encourages them to help when they see a need, and to do so in a down-to-earth manner. However, our research suggests that this awareness is likely stronger among Turbulent Defenders. Both forms of Defenders have a liking for thoroughness. But because of their ever-watchful and often worried eyes, Turbulent Defenders typically remain the more detail-oriented of the two. They often spot problems long before their Assertive counterparts do. This awareness can be a powerful tool that allows Turbulent Defenders to size up potential problems. But it can consume them. Compared to Assertive Defenders, more of them spend time worrying about things they can\u2019t control in life, which can lead to frustration, disappointment, and even sadness. These personalities can take on too much responsibility for negative situations they notice around them. Turbulent Defenders may see all that can be fixed in their world and frequently feel like they haven\u2019t done enough. They very easily find fault with themselves, even if they don\u2019t deserve it. They typically don\u2019t have enough emotional armor protecting them, and these sensitive personalities end up blaming themselves too often and too quickly. 82% of Assertive Defenders say they prefer focusing on and managing how things are rather than how they should be, compared to 45% of Turbulent Defenders. \u201cPRACTICAL MIND\u201d SURVEY Assertive Defenders likely take on some of the responsibility when things go wrong as well. This is part of the sensitivity that defines Defender personality types. But they\u2019re likely to be less affected by it and to know when to let go of difficulties. Assertive Defenders report, at a higher percentage, that they can release their worries soon after they realize that they have no control over such matters. These Defenders may even balance their perception of negative things with other, more positive thoughts about the state of affairs, leaving them to focus more on the bright side. But this positive outlook can draw their attention away from problems on which they might be better off focusing. 71% of Turbulent Defenders say they are often (or very often) sad, compared to 44% of Assertive Defenders. \u201cSADNESS\u201d SURVEY The Assertive Defenders\u2019 approach to caring may take much less of an emotional toll on them. Assertive personality types generally report being happier than Turbulent personality types. This is no less true for Defenders. But this shouldn\u2019t leave Turbulent Defenders discouraged. There may be a trade-off here. Their higher levels of awareness and their vigilance might give them a head start on finding successful solutions. In turn, this can create a point of pride. Instead of a superficial sense of happiness, these personalities may find a strong enough sense of purpose that makes any negative feelings worth it for them. Besides, happiness is a subjective term that means different things to different people. Defenders, Identity Differences, and People 51% of Assertive Defenders say they have received specific recognitions, awards, or honors in their careers, compared to 28% of Turbulent Defenders. \u201cCAREERS\u201d SURVEY Neither Assertive nor Turbulent Defenders are prone to bragging or seeking credit. Both behaviors are likely too showy for them. But Assertive Defenders report that they\u2019ve received more recognition or awards for the things they do at work than their Turbulent counterparts. Does this mean that these personalities are better at the work they do? Not necessarily. Introversion meets a lack of confidence in Turbulent Defenders, and because of this, they may hold back from letting their lights shine. They may fear appearing flashy. On the other hand, Assertive Defenders are generally more confidently proactive and thus more visible. Those more visible in society have a greater likelihood of winning awards. This doesn\u2019t mean that Turbulent Defenders aren\u2019t working just as effectively in their more reserved style. Often, they may find themselves in a place of propping others up at the expense of their own recognition. Turbulent Defenders also regard the opinions of others as important. Many state that the approval of others remains vital to their decision-making processes. Their Turbulent tendency is to wait until all the relevant people have had their say before they act. This can stall any actions these personalities may want to pursue. Their careful attempt at gaining a consensus may leave them looking a little less energetic. 64% of Assertive Defenders say they are harder to offend than most people, compared to 18% of Turbulent Defenders. \u201cCRITICISM\u201d SURVEY Defenders are typically too sensitive and concerned for others to act like bulls in china shops \u2013 as is sometimes the stereotypical case with their Assertive cousins from other personality types. Still, the Assertive Defenders\u2019 relative boldness can have them moving faster than Turbulent Defenders in some situations. Though usually cautious, they may not always get as full an understanding of things before they act as their counterparts do. Similarly, the opinions of others sit lower on Assertive Defenders\u2019 list of things they typically consider essential. Because of this, these personalities may be a little more likely than their Turbulent counterparts to advise people without first checking to find out what they want or need. Their confidence, paired with their lower sensitivity to the opinions of others, may sometimes convince them that they know what is best for those around them. Turbulent Defenders might find their cautious nature helpful. A gentler, more careful approach may sometimes be the right style, and Turbulent Defenders are more likely to weigh what the people in their lives say they want and need. This can make them much more considerate, and it allows them to come from a place of greater understanding. Often in life, people don\u2019t want to be \u201cfixed.\u201d They want to be heard. And while both types of Defender are likely to listen to a reasonable degree, Turbulent Defenders are somewhat more poised to hear what others have to say. Summary Turbulent Defenders more actively anticipate problems. This can help them head off problems before they become bigger. Assertive Defenders are likely to let go of things they cannot control. Fewer Turbulent Defenders report that they do, which may leave them worrying about matters they can do little about. Turbulent Defenders are quick to blame themselves when something goes wrong. Assertive Defenders acknowledge problems, but with an eye toward silver linings. This may, at times, divert these personalities from the seriousness of a setback. Assertive Defenders are likely more visible in the workplace. They may receive more recognition for their accomplishments than Turbulent Defenders because of this. Turbulent Defenders rely on the opinions of others more. Sorting out opinions may slow some of their progress, but it may also help them be better listeners. Since Assertive Defenders do not place as much value on the opinions of others, they may not listen to others as carefully as Turbulent Defenders. Assertive Defenders may be somewhat more prone to confidently assuming that they know what someone needs or wants rather than asking them. Generous Souls Nothing is wasted in the world of personality types, and all types and traits have their unique superpowers. With Defenders, we find that Assertive Defenders tend to move the ball forward in more robust and positive ways. They are typically quicker to act and more decisive. Turbulent Defenders are more vigilant and focused on potential problems. They are more likely to value the opinions of others and seek a consensus before they advance. When all is said and done, however, both variants of this \u201csalt of the earth\u201d personality type are likely to be loyal, caring, and hardworking. Defenders are generous individuals and have much to offer the world."}]}

Consuls are well-organized, enjoying bringing order and structure to their workplaces, and often work best in environments with clear, predictable hierarchies and tasks. Monotony and routine work are not a challenge for the Consul personality type, as they are happy to do what needs to be done. Altruistic Motivations Careers as administrators are a natural fit, allowing Consuls to organize not just an environment, but the people in it. Their practical skills combine well with their dependability, making Consul personalities surprisingly good accountants \u2013 though they often prefer to be personal accountants, helping people and interacting with them directly, instead of corporate accountants crunching numbers in some back room. Purely analytical careers are often too dull for Consuls though \u2013 they need human interaction and emotional feedback to be truly satisfied in their line of work. Good listeners and enthusiastic team members, people with the Consul personality type are excellent providers of medical care and social work. Teaching is another great option, as Consuls are comfortable with authority, but are supportive and friendly enough to keep that authority from feeling overbearing. Consuls\u2019 best careers all have the additional benefit of providing them with perhaps their most important requirement: to feel appreciated and know they\u2019ve helped someone. Being as altruistic as they are, Consuls find it hard to be satisfied unless they know they\u2019ve done something valuable for another person. This is often the driving force behind Consuls\u2019 careers and career advancement, and makes religious work and counseling particularly rewarding.

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ENTJ's Personality Type Background"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Introduction Who is A Commander (ENTJ)? A Commander (ENTJ) is someone with the Extraverted , Intuitive , Thinking , and Judging personality traits. They are decisive people who love momentum and accomplishment. They gather information to construct their creative visions but rarely hesitate for long before acting on them. Your time is limited, so don\u2019t waste it living someone else\u2019s life. Steve Jobs Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they\u2019ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world \u2013 but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day. Striving for Greatness If there\u2019s anything Commanders love, it\u2019s a good challenge, big or small, and they firmly believe that given enough time and resources, they can achieve any goal. This quality makes people with the Commander personality type brilliant entrepreneurs, and their ability to think strategically and hold a long-term focus while executing each step of their plans with determination and precision makes them powerful business leaders. This determination is often a self-fulfilling prophecy, as Commanders push their goals through with sheer willpower where others might give up and move on, and their Extraverted (E) nature means they are likely to push everyone else right along with them, achieving spectacular results in the process. At the negotiating table, be it in a corporate environment or buying a car, Commanders are dominant, relentless, and unforgiving. This isn\u2019t because they are coldhearted or vicious per se \u2013 it\u2019s more that Commander personalities genuinely enjoy the challenge, the battle of wits, the repartee that comes from this environment, and if the other side can\u2019t keep up, that\u2019s no reason for Commanders to fold on their own core tenet of ultimate victory. The underlying thought running through the Commander mind might be something like \"I don\u2019t care if you call me an insensitive b*****d, as long as I remain an efficient b*****d\". If there\u2019s anyone Commanders respect, it\u2019s someone who is able to stand up to them intellectually, who is able to act with a precision and quality equal to their own. Commander personalities have a particular skill in recognizing the talents of others, and this helps in both their team-building efforts (since no one, no matter how brilliant, can do everything alone), and to keep Commanders from displaying too much arrogance and condescension. However, they also have a particular skill in calling out others\u2019 failures with a chilling degree of insensitivity, and this is where Commanders really start to run into trouble. A Worthy Challenge Emotional expression isn\u2019t the strong suit of any Analyst type, but Commanders\u2019 distance from their emotions is especially public, and felt directly by a much broader swath of people. Especially in a professional environment, Commanders will simply crush the sensitivities of those they view as inefficient, incompetent or lazy. To people with the Commander personality type, emotional displays are displays of weakness, and it\u2019s easy to make enemies with this approach \u2013 Commanders will do well to remember that they absolutely depend on having a functioning team, not just to achieve their goals, but for their validation and feedback as well, something Commanders are, curiously, very sensitive to. Commanders are true powerhouses, and they cultivate an image of being larger than life \u2013 and often enough they are. They need to remember though, that their stature comes not just from their own actions, but from the actions of the team that props them up, and that it\u2019s important to recognize the contributions, talents and needs, especially from an emotional perspective, of their support network. Even if they have to adopt a \"fake it \u2018til you make it\" mentality, if Commanders are able to combine an emotionally healthy focus alongside their many strengths, they will be rewarded with deep, satisfying relationships and all the challenging victories they can handle."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert in Psychology and Personalities, especially about MBTI personality types. You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ESFJ's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Consuls , both a practical and outgoing personality type, are set apart somewhat by whether they fall under the Assertive (ESFJ-A) or Turbulent (ESFJ-T) Identity . When viewed this way, they maintain their core Consul characteristics. But the way those characteristics unfold in their lives can be quite different. Let\u2019s let the research guide us in discovering how their Identity differences might play out in their lives. The Inner Lives of Assertive and Turbulent Consuls 59% of Turbulent Consuls say they often dwell on their regrets, compared to 31% of Assertive Consuls. \u201cREGRET: GENERAL ATTITUDES\u201d SURVEY How Assertive and Turbulent Consul personalities each deal with regrets can tell us much about their fundamental differences. Both types do deal with their personal failures. But Assertive Consuls say they regret outcomes more than behaviors, while Turbulent Consuls regret their actions more. Assertive Consuls\u2019 optimistic outlook may allow them to justify specific behaviors more easily than outcomes. Outcomes are generally more straightforward, lending themselves more readily to being measured objectively. Assertive Consuls are also more likely to say that regrettable things motivate them, thus allowing them to put a positive spin on their disappointments. But the most telling difference might be that they also let go of their regret more quickly than Turbulent Consuls. Turbulent Consuls tend to focus more on their behaviors when they feel regret. These personalities often assign themselves personal blame for problems. Consequently, they may see the actions they are sorry for as linked to their real (or imagined) flaws. Rather than see their regrets as having any positive value, this type of Consul would sooner see them disappear, perhaps perceiving them as an indictment of their reliability. They generally avoid even talking about them. 73% of Assertive Consuls say they find it easy to focus on the good things in their lives when they\u2019re feeling down, compared to 43% of Turbulent Consuls. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST?\u201d SURVEY Assertive Consuls even actively look for ways out of their difficult emotions. They typically report wanting to speed up the grieving process more than Turbulent Consuls. They are likely interested in getting past anything that distracts them from their goals or the people in their lives. Assertive Consuls are generally willing to deal with their feelings, but they may be quicker to see them as a drawback if painful emotions linger too long. Turbulent Consuls may find coping with negatives more challenging. But it would be inaccurate to portray Turbulent Consuls as mired in unhappiness because of this. Their social support system alone is likely to help lift them soon enough, and they generally report being content in life. But, relatively speaking, negatives may be stickier for these personalities \u2013 and remain in their lives a while longer. 86% of Assertive Consuls feel they effectively manage the stress in their lives, compared to 60% of Turbulent Consuls. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Consuls describe their approach to life with a sort of energetic ease that taps into their confident focus. This approach colors how these personalities deal with stressors that develop. They are likely to be bold in their belief that they can deal with any difficulty life throws their way. They may be prone to seeing life\u2019s difficulties as just another task to be skillfully taken on. Fewer Turbulent Consuls see themselves as being skilled at dealing with stress, when we hold them up beside Assertive Consuls. However, this is a comparison. In general terms, more of them see themselves as effectively managing stress than don\u2019t. Turbulent Consuls also have a somewhat higher tendency to see worrying too much as something that helps them do their best. While Assertive Consuls see challenges as motivating, Turbulent Consuls are more likely to see worry as something that elicits a beneficial response from them. The end results for each personality type may be very similar, but they come from different places. 72% of Assertive Consuls say they usually win the battle with themselves when trying to be disciplined, compared to 41% of Turbulent Consuls. \u201cSELF-DISCIPLINE\u201d SURVEY Both types of Consuls generally describe their attitudes and behaviors in ways that can be seen only as disciplined. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Assertive Consuls and Turbulent Consuls see their self-discipline the same way. Turbulent Consuls tend to be harder on themselves when asked to describe their self-discipline in more general terms. They may not appreciate how disciplined they are. A praiseworthy level of self-discipline in the eyes of Assertive Consuls may not look as positive to Turbulent Consuls. They may have trouble seeing self-control that isn\u2019t perfect as being \u201cgood enough,\u201d no matter how close to flawless it might be. However, trying to compensate for the sense that they lack self-discipline may drive them to increase their efforts, potentially bringing about more positive results. Assertive Consuls are more likely to say they find motivation when things become difficult. This positive approach may cause these Consuls to be one of the personality types better suited to adopt the adage: \u201cWhen the going gets tough, the tough get going.\u201d Consul Identity Differences When Connecting with Others 59% of Turbulent Consuls say they only remain in some relationships because they don\u2019t want to hurt the other person, compared to 31% of Assertive Consuls. \u201cGIVING UP AND LETTING GO\u201d SURVEY Social connections are crucial to the Consul personality type. Turbulent Consuls are likely to be more dependent on others. Relative dependency does not mean that they are all needy. But they lean toward needing people more than Assertive Consuls do. They are more sensitive, more aware of those who enter their lives \u2013 and of those who leave them. Assertive Consuls are by no means loners or indifferent to those who enter or leave their social circles. True to Assertive form in all personality types, they are more apt to keep their own counsel and to make their own decisions, but only in comparison to their Turbulent counterparts. In the general scheme of things, they are somewhat collaborative for an Assertive type. 93% of Assertive Consuls said that if they disagreed with everyone else in a ten-person group, they would speak up, compared to 63% of Turbulent Consuls. \u201cSOCIAL PRESSURES\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Consuls can become social chameleons. Some find it helpful to change their behaviors and opinions depending on who else is in the room. Turbulent Consuls tend to believe that their reputations are formed by what others think of them, more than basing it on what they do independent of that. These personalities are much more likely to find it hard to say no to a social invitation, probably to avoid offending anyone. When something involves social matters, Turbulent Consuls tend to make more concessions than their Assertive counterparts. Turbulent Consuls are less likely to speak their minds if they disagree with something. But if a single person in that group joins them in their disagreement, the chances of them standing their ground goes up. That suggests safety in numbers rather than only trying to curry favor with others by stifling their dissent. The two dissenters have established a team with something in common. Assertive Consuls are likely to not care quite as much about the opinions of others. While their reputation within a group is still very valuable to them, the importance they place on it pales slightly when compared to their Turbulent counterparts. Assertive Consuls remain very interested in maintaining relationships. Such ties are vital to this personality type. However, they are somewhat less likely to surrender their independent ideas and opinions to guarantee a bonding experience. 83% of Turbulent Consuls say that some things are unforgivable, compared to 56% of Assertive Consuls. \u201cFORGIVENESS\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Consuls strongly desire to promote themselves socially and preserve their relationships, but when someone crosses a line with them, all bets are likely off. These personalities are much more prone to getting angry when they feel slighted or offended than Assertive Consuls. They are occasionally willing to condemn the actions of others as unforgivable. Still, we can expect it to take a lot to get this personality type to that point, and they are likely to react because they are deeply hurt, rather than because they\u2019re being aggressive. Summary Assertive Consuls are more likely to regret outcomes and are more likely to find their regrets motivational. Turbulent Consuls regret their behaviors and are prone to ruminating over them. Turbulent Consuls usually find it harder to let go of painful feelings. Assertive Consuls typically want to alleviate hurtful emotions quickly and perhaps even to speed through a feeling like grief. Self-discipline is essential to both Consul personality types, but most Assertive Consuls view themselves as successful at self-discipline, while most Turbulent Consuls do not. However, this may be more a result of Turbulent Consuls\u2019 tendency to see negatives in themselves, instead of assessing themselves objectively. Turbulent Consuls are more likely than Assertive Consuls to need other people and may even stay in a relationship long after it\u2019s a good one. If someone wrongs Turbulent Consuls, they may feel hurt to the point that it becomes hard for the offender to earn forgiveness. However, the situation likely must hit the level of being the \u201clast straw\u201d for Turbulent Consuls to react so strongly. Assertive and Turbulent Consuls: Responsible, Caring, and Unique When Consuls enjoy the unique qualities that define their Identities, they reinforce the concept of all types having value. Assertive Consuls operate in a mind-set that allows streamlining of their practical efforts. They move more lightly and without carrying quite as much emotional baggage. Their style can come in quite handy when quick reactions are needed. Turbulent Consuls, however, may use their tendency to access their emotions in their own practical ways. While both connect well with others, Turbulent Consuls may have a slight, but significant, edge. They may connect with others better on a \u201cfeelings\u201d level. But both personality types are good to have around."}]}

People with the Consul personality type thrive on social order and harmony, and use their warmth and social intelligence to make sure that each person knows their responsibilities and is able to get done what needs to get done. Consuls are comfortable, even dependent on clear hierarchies and roles, and whether subordinates, colleagues or managers, Consul personalities expect authority to be respected and backed up by rules and standards. Consul Subordinates With clearly defined responsibilities and a sense of purpose, Consuls are patient, efficient, hard-working people who respect the authority of their managers. While Consuls may struggle with too much freedom and improvisation, they thrive in workplaces with structure, safety and guidelines. Routine tasks are not a problem for Consuls, and their dedication and loyalty earn them the respect of their managers. Consul Colleagues Teamwork is a concept that Consuls have no trouble putting into practice. Often seeking friends at work, people with this personality type are almost always willing to lend a hand when and where it\u2019s needed. Excellent networkers, Consuls always seem to \u201cknow just the guy\u201d to bring a project together on time. On the other hand, Consuls often need to work on a team \u2013 being stuck alone chipping away at paperwork for days on end just leaves them tired and unfulfilled. Consuls take pride in these qualities, which has the side effect of making them particularly sensitive when they come under criticism. When their suggestions and help are turned down, Consul personalities can take it personally. Already somewhat vulnerable to stress, rejections like these can be pretty demoralizing, and Consuls may need their coworkers to make an effort to express their appreciation from time to time. Consul Managers Consuls enjoy the responsibility that comes with organizing social situations, and the enjoyment they feel in managing other people translates well into management positions. As team leaders, Consuls find ways to make everyone feel involved, uniting people and smoothing relations in order to get things done. At the same time, Consuls have a strong respect for traditional power structures, and if after all their efforts convincing their subordinates to work together someone ends up challenging their authority, they can stress out, lose their temper, and just generally react badly. People with the Consul personality type are sensitive about their status and dislike conflict, and prefer situations where everyone knows their role. So long as expectations are clearly outlined, Consuls are effective and enjoyable managers."}]}

But what happens when we add one more characteristic to the mix: Identity ? Both Assertive Architects (INTJ-A)\u00a0and Turbulent Architects (INTJ-T)\u00a0maintain their similarities and value the same things, but with a twist that adds important, functional nuance to their expression of Architect qualities. This Identity difference probably influences every part of their lives in some way. For our purposes (and for brevity\u2019s sake), we\u2019ll explore a few of the more apparent areas where our research shows a gap between the two types of Architects. Are you a Turbulent Architect? Check out \u201cTurbulent Architect Superpowers\u201d at the bottom of this article for the deepest insights into who you are. Expressing Ambition Differently Assertive Architects are likely to approach the things they do with a greater degree of self-assurance. These Architects feel more confident about handling the stressors that are inevitably a part of life. They are less likely to experience regret if things go wrong. So, stressors and past failures are less likely to be motivators. However, confidence isn\u2019t everything and may not always guarantee success. For Turbulent Architects, many of their best efforts come from concerns about real or perceived shortcomings. This may push them to work harder and be more meticulous in an attempt to do better or make things better. These personalities are more thorough \u2013 not despite the fact that they worry, but because they do worry. Turbulent Architects are likely to carry their diligent desire for improvement into any of their personal or professional endeavors. 93% of Assertive Architects trust themselves to overcome any challenges life can throw their way, compared to 71% of Turbulent Architects. \u201cRELYING ON OTHERS\u201d SURVEY All Architect personalities feel fairly confident when facing challenges and regard rational problem-solving highly. But Turbulent Architects more typically find any imperfections in a system very early in the process. This is due to their more worrisome nature, which creates a kind of hypervigilance. Their analytical nature then helps them find useful solutions, sometimes even before others realize such a solution is needed. This foresight can create a solid reputation that elevates them at work and at home. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that Turbulent Architects always follow through on the solutions they develop. The same apprehension that allows these personalities to find problems early in the process might also prevent them from mentioning such flaws to others. \u201cHow can this go wrong?\u201d might be replaced by, \u201cWhat if I\u2019m wrong?\u201d This new question may stifle any impulse to share insights and solutions. 49% of Turbulent Architects are often afraid of making decisions, compared to 18% of Assertive Architects. \u201cNEED FOR CONTROL\u201d SURVEY Both types of Architects lean toward being ambitious. But there\u2019s a potential trap in thinking that Assertive Architects are less ambitious than their Turbulent counterparts because they come across as less intense. Their confidence may make them look like they are effortlessly and casually cruising along with few signs of visible stress. Some may interpret this relaxed demeanor as apathy. Assertive Architects can care as much as Turbulent Architects \u2013 it\u2019s just that their motivation comes from somewhere different. It comes more from within rather than from without and from a place of certainty rather than uncertainty. This allows for a steadier gait that\u2019s less influenced by any fluctuations around them. Their confidence places a lot of faith in their logic and understanding, and that conviction glides Assertive Architect personalities toward their accomplishments. Dealing with Change and the Unexpected The slightly more adventurous Assertive Architects are likely to feel better equipped to handle whatever life throws at them \u2013 especially with strategies and decision-making. They are more likely than Turbulent Architects to report that they believe bad luck has a positive side. To these personalities, things are rarely so dire that they can\u2019t handle them. While they prefer stability, they\u2019re not likely to fear instability. However, Assertive Architect personalities can be a little more rigid than their Turbulent counterparts with intentional change. While they can be forward-thinking and visionary, they may see more mundane things as being fine just as they are, with no need to alter anything on a practical level. They may not have the impetus of improvement behind their regard for change and may not feel as much of a need to apply smaller tweaks to a system. But this is not so for Turbulent Architects. Though influenced by their stability-oriented Judging personality trait, they\u2019re somewhat more likely than Assertive Architects to say they often change both their long- and short-term goals. 32% of Turbulent Architects say they often change their long-term goals, compared to 17% of Assertive Architects. \u201cTEMPTATION\u201d SURVEY While neither Architect is typically big on changing their goals, a relative willingness to change is a true Turbulent difference. Turbulent personality types, with an eye always aimed at improvement, commonly deal with the moving targets and shifting methods that are often necessary to change something for the better. As much as Turbulent Architects value stability and consistency, they will shake things up \u2013 but only if doing so clearly paves the way to better results. Responding to the People in Their Lives: The Same but Different While both are sometimes uncomfortable expressing feelings, Turbulent Architects are relatively more likely to let their emotions play a role. These personalities consistently report, for example, that they are more easily provoked and more likely to feel fear \u2013 especially fear of uncertainty. More Turbulent Architects say they are emotionally expressive in general when compared to their Assertive counterparts. 81% of Assertive Architects say they are rarely or very rarely offended by someone, compared to 41% of Turbulent Architects. \u201cBEING OFFENDED\u201d SURVEY Humans are emotional creatures. Turbulent Architects\u2019 different levels of expressiveness and relative need for people may give them an advantage over Assertive Architects for connecting with others. Turbulent Architects may get more buy-in for their ideas from others because of their more approachable, open attitude. They are also more likely to feel the need to ask for advice \u2013 but then find it more difficult than Assertive personalities to make the request. Nonetheless, it shows that they value what others have to offer. Assertive Architects are likely to take a somewhat more independent approach. A larger percentage of Assertive Architects report that they\u2019re comfortable around authority figures than their Turbulent counterparts. These Assertive personality types may not be as held back by concern over how others might judge them \u2013 potentially creating a more independent attitude. 72% of Turbulent Architects feel pressured to live up to a certain standard (e.g., home, car, salary), compared to 45% of Assertive Architects. \u201cSOCIAL PRESSURES\u201d SURVEY There are certain advantages to this difference. More independent actors, like the Assertive Architects, may have greater autonomy and enjoy a more streamlined decision-making process. Depending on the task, a single person can often be agile in a way that a group cannot. But independence can also make them appear unwilling to listen to others or take their needs and wants seriously. This can make collaboration and teamwork difficult. In Summary Turbulent Architects are often fueled by their worries and concerns, and these can be used to make significant progress. They can often see problems (and sometimes find solutions) long before others. Stress affects Assertive Architects less, but this should not be confused with their not caring. Both types of Architects are often ambitious \u2013 but their motivations are different. Assertive Architects are motivated more from within, and their inspiration to act is based on confidence in their rationality. Turbulent Architects are moved forward in life to a greater degree by their concerns, worries, and how others might see them. While neither personality type is likely to be very comfortable with their emotions, Turbulent Architects are more likely to express theirs and use them to connect with others by being more approachable. Assertive Architects are less likely to be as concerned about the opinions of others. They relish their independence and make decisions on their own. Both personality types need order and predictability, but Assertive Architects are slightly more adventurous than Turbulent Architects. They prefer stability but don\u2019t necessarily fear instability. However, Turbulent Architects are often more willing to change intentionally than their Assertive cousins. Shared Foundations When we focus on the Identity personality traits, it\u2019s important to remember that one is not better or more legitimate than the other. A Turbulent Architect is no less of an Architect than an Assertive Architect, and vice versa. It\u2019s like spice in a stew. All the main ingredients are there \u2013 but add some savory spices to increase its sweetness, sourness, or heat, and the stew is suddenly something a bit different. The world needs confident Architects to boldly present their many ideas and insights. It also needs cautious Architects to anticipate problems and to care about and respond to opinions. Their unique differences, no matter how subtle or pronounced, can contribute to the world \u2013 each in their own ways."}]}

No other personality type is better suited than Commanders to be the respected leader of an organization or team, and no other personality type enjoys it quite so much. Combining their vision, intelligence and determination to push ideas through to completion no matter the obstacles, Commanders are a force to be reckoned with. A Singular Vision In the world of business, the sometimes overbearing level of self-confidence that Commanders (especially Assertive ones) too often mishandle in their personal relationships is transformed into an admirable authority, keeping people on track and getting things done. Naturally the best careers for people with the Commander personality type make the fullest use of these qualities, and many would describe executive positions and entrepreneurialism to be ideal lines of work \u2013 any position high enough that they can clearly see the horizon. For Commanders, failure is not an option \u2013 they conceive a vision of the future, formulate a strategy to achieve that vision, and execute each step with ruthless precision. Structure and order are key, and if someone gets sloppy, or holds things back with incompetence, laziness or inefficiency, Commanders will not hesitate to come down, hard. Commander personalities pursue their goals with singular vision, and have strict standards for themselves and others that are designed above all else to be effective. This makes Commanders excellent corporate strategists, and their objectivity and clarity of thought make them respected lawyers and judges. None of this could work if no one could understand what Commanders were thinking, and they have the good fortune of being clear and concise communicators, especially in person, making business administration a comfortable fit \u2013 so long as their tasks don\u2019t stray too far into routine maintenance and upkeep. Commanders also have a thirst for knowledge, and they aren\u2019t afraid to use a principle once they\u2019ve grasped its underlying mechanisms. Combining this with their leadership makes Commanders trying, but effective, university professors. Great Expectations The only problem is, it takes time for Commanders\u2019 skills to be recognized, and stagnating as low-level employees will have them bouncing off the walls and deeply unhappy. People with the Commander personality type crave leadership and responsibility, growth and opportunity, and genuinely enjoy managing others to get a job done. Commanders are visionaries and leaders, not grunts or day-to-day administrators. Getting that to be recognized is not always easy, but Commanders are probably up to the task."}]}
