# EmoAI: Your Virtual Companion

## Introduction

Our project  - EmoAI - aims to address the growing need for mental health support, mental companionship and social interaction in the wake of challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic. This innovative platform offers users the ability to create virtual friends, leveraging the power of advanced technologies including Large Language Models (LLMs) for chatbot functionality, DALL-E for personalized visual design, and Whisper for audio interaction. Built with a responsive front-end using React.js and a robust Django back-end, EmoAI is not just an app – it's a companion in the digital age.

## Features

- **Virtual Friend Creation**: Design and interact with your AI-powered virtual friends.
- **Customizable Avatars**: Use DALL-E's capabilities to create unique avatars for your virtual friends.
- **Advanced Chatbot Interaction**: Engage in meaningful conversations powered by finetuned GPT models & Knowledge Retrieval (Webscraping from X & Quora & 16Personalities).
- **Voice Interaction**: Experience natural conversations with Whisper-driven audio functionality. [Under Development]
- **UI & UX**: Navigate with a user-friendly, intuitive interface built on React.js.

### Whisper-1
- **Description**: Whisper is an automatic speech recognition system that approaches human-level robustness and accuracy, trained on a vast and diverse dataset
- **Uses**: In EmoAI, Whisper is utilized for transcribing user speech, enabling voice-to-text capabilities for interacting with virtual companions
- **Sources**: OpenAI has trained Whisper and provides open-source access to the models and inference code
- **Permissions**: The open-sourcing of Whisper encourages its use for building applications and further research on robust speech processing
- **Code**: OpenAI provides the architecture and code, which includes an encoder-decoder Transformer model, for developers to implement Whisper in their applications

### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Model tts-1-hd-1106 [New Model]
- **Description**: A high-definition text-to-speech model capable of converting text into lifelike spoken audio.
- **Uses**: This model is used in EmoAI to provide voice responses from virtual companions, enhancing the user experience with natural-sounding speech.
- **Sources**: [New Model]
- **Permissions**: [New Model]
- **Code**: [New Model]

## Critical Analysis

### Impact of the Project
EmoAI has the potential to significantly impact mental health by providing a readily available source of companionship and support. This technology bridges the gap for those who may be isolated or unable to access traditional support structures. By providing a non-judgmental, always-available AI friend, EmoAI can help reduce the weight of loneliness and may encourage individuals to take further steps in their mental health journey, potentially acting as a catalyst for seeking professional mental health services.

### What EmoAI Reveals or Suggests
Through user interactions, EmoAI can collect data that shed a light on prevalent mental health challenges and the types of support users seek from virtual companions. These insights could be invaluable for mental health professionals, allowing them to tailor their services to meet the evolving needs revealed by EmoAI interaction patterns. Additionally, it suggests the importance of emotional intelligence in AI development, underlining the role AI can play in promoting mental well-being.

### The Next Step
- AI virtual communities (AI towns)
- Audio feature
- Better UI & UX
- Feedbacks from users
- Social Media Posts for fine-tuning (more-real-life-like-interactions)
- Each MBTI type with one fine-tuned model
- A new page for Conversation logs & continue chat with friends
- More around data security & ethical concerns

The goal is to create an AI companion that not only understands but resonates with the emotional states of users from diverse linguistic backgrounds, ultimately making mental health support more universally accessible.
