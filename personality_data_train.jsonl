An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the Introverted , Intuitive , Thinking , and Judging personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one. \u201cThought constitutes the greatness of man. Man is a reed, the feeblest thing in nature, but he is a thinking reed.\u201d Blaise Pascal It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types \u2013 and one of the most capable \u2013 Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects pride themselves on their ability to think for themselves, not to mention their uncanny knack for seeing right through phoniness and hypocrisy. But because their minds are never at rest, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them. A Pioneering Spirit Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people\u2019s expertise to guide their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren\u2019t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval \u2013 in fact, they rather enjoy it. But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn\u2019t worth anything unless it actually works. Architects want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their work, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. And heaven help anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism. Architects, independent to the core, want to shake off other people\u2019s expectations and pursue their own ideas. This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. Architects don\u2019t mind acting alone, perhaps because they don\u2019t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also generally prefer making decisions without asking for anyone else\u2019s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration other people\u2019s thoughts, desires, and plans. It would be a mistake, however, to view Architects as uncaring. Whatever the stereotypes about their stoic intellect, these personalities feel deeply. When things go wrong or when they hurt others, Architects are personally affected and spend much time and energy trying to figure out why things happened the way that they did. They may not always value emotion as a decision-making tool, but they are authentically human. A Thirst for Knowledge Architects can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. They believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging goals. But these personalities may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity. People with the Architect personality type derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, they may have been called \u201cbookworms\u201d or \u201cnerds.\u201d But rather than taking these labels as insults, many Architects embrace them. They recognize their own ability to teach themselves about \u2013 and master \u2013 any topic that interests them, whether that\u2019s coding or capoeira or classical music. Architects don\u2019t just learn new things for show \u2013 they genuinely enjoy expanding the limits of their knowledge. Architects can be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, they\u2019re far from dull or humorless. Many Architects are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor. Social Frustrations Architects aren\u2019t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries \u2013 in other words, they\u2019d rather be right than popular. This may explain why so many fictional villains are modeled on this personality type. Because Architects value truth and depth, many common social practices \u2013 from small talk to white lies \u2013 may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they\u2019re only trying to be honest. At times, Architects may wonder whether dealing with other people is even worth the frustration. But like any personality type, Architects do crave social interaction \u2013 they\u2019d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When Architects pursue their interests, their natural confidence can draw people to them \u2013 professionally, socially, and even romantically. The Chess Game of Life Architects are full of contradictions. They are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of the Architect mind. For these personalities, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, Architects contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win \u2013 no matter what challenges might arise along the way."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "INFJ's Workplace habits"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Workplace Habits Advocates (INFJs) have some specific needs when it comes to a satisfying work environment. For people with this personality type, the most rewarding work allows them to help others while also growing as a person. And it\u2019s a given that an ideal career for Advocates must be in line with their individual values. Anything that gets in the way of these values \u2013 from red tape and meaningless rules to office politics and unscrupulous coworkers \u2013 can seriously sap Advocates\u2019 motivation. This is a personality type that thrives in environments that promote fairness and equality. Most Advocates prefer not to think of themselves as above or below anyone else \u2013 no matter where they are on the job ladder. Advocate Subordinates Advocates value cooperation, sensitivity, and independence. As employees, they gravitate toward managers who are open-minded and willing to consider their input. Advocate personalities may become frustrated when they feel unheard, so having a manager who listens to them can make all the difference. Ideally, Advocates will find a manager whose values align with their own and who offers them encouragement and praise. Because Advocates tend to act on their convictions and aim to do their best, their morale can be vulnerable to criticism, particularly if it\u2019s unwarranted. Other morale killers for these personalities may include strict rules, formal structures, and routine tasks. They may find it especially dispiriting when they\u2019re asked to redo their work, particularly if it\u2019s for a reason that just doesn\u2019t seem valid to them. Of course, a perfect work environment isn\u2019t always possible. Advocate employees with less-than-ideal managers may need to draw on their inner resilience and seek out other mentors. The good news is that people with this personality type are more than capable of handling workplace challenges, including the challenge of having a difficult manager. Advocate Colleagues As colleagues, Advocates can be quite popular and well respected. People with this personality type are often seen as helpful, eloquent, and capable coworkers. Among their greatest strengths is their ability to identify others\u2019 motives and understand the root causes of conflict before anyone else even senses a disturbance. At times, efficiency may be less of a priority for Advocates than collaborating with and helping colleagues who need a boost. While this is usually a strength, there is a risk that others will take advantage of Advocates\u2019 desire to help. They may find themselves picking up the slack for their less dedicated coworkers at the expense of their own energy and well-being. Advocates\u2019 determination to be helpful can leave them feeling taken advantage of. Although they tend to be well liked among their colleagues, Advocates are still Introverts. From time to time, they may need to step back and work alone, pursuing their own goals in their own ways. This isn\u2019t a sign of resentment or ill will \u2013 but rather a signal of Advocates\u2019 need to balance serving others with their own self-care. Advocate Managers As managers, Advocates may dislike wielding their power. They prefer to think of everyone as equals, no matter what a person\u2019s business card might say. Rather than micromanage their subordinates, Advocates often prefer to empower them to think and act independently. They work hard to encourage others and promote an atmosphere of mutual respect. Compassionate and fair, Advocate managers often take pride in identifying their subordinates\u2019 unique strengths. That\u2019s not to say that Advocates have low standards \u2013 far from it. Their sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to live up to the standards that they set for themselves. Bosses with this personality type want their employees to be rigorous, motivated, reliable, and unfailingly honest, and they will notice if anyone misses the mark. Advocate managers can be particularly stern if they catch someone behaving in a way that they consider unethical. These personalities have little tolerance for lapses in reliability or morality. When their employees\u2019 good intentions match their own, however, Advocate bosses work tirelessly to ensure that their entire team feels valued, fulfilled, and successful."}]}

They don\u2019t internalize much of anything, sharing it all with their extensive circles of friends with wit, style, enthusiasm, and optimism. Entertainers are explorers of the pleasures of life, and they take particular pleasure in sharing those experiences with others. For Entertainers, there\u2019s no point in living if you can\u2019t feel alive. Making Life Interesting Entertainers are people of action. Getting out with activities that engage all five senses is Entertainer personalities\u2019 idea of a good time. Sometimes though, Entertainers may go too far with risky or careless behaviors, and try to bring others along for the ride. People with this personality type are sensitive, and rejecting these pastimes can be taken personally, ending friendships then and there. Entertainers don\u2019t have time to be lectured. Making new friends isn\u2019t a problem for Entertainers though \u2013 they use an alluring combination of blunt truths and disarming openness and charm to keep things moving. Where Entertainer personalities falter is in keeping the friends they already have. In their excitement and focus on here and now over history, Entertainers too easily exhaust the adventure one person has to offer, moving on once one person\u2019s novelty has worn off. This can all give the impression that Entertainers are shallow, pleasure-centric creatures who care little for anyone but themselves. This is a terrible misunderstanding, and far from the truth, but nevertheless makes friendships with Intuitive (N) personality types challenging. Entertainers care sincerely about their friends \u2013 it\u2019s why they put so much effort into coming up with group experiences they believe everyone will enjoy \u2013 and they are deeply distressed by the occasional conflicts that end these relationships. As they grow and mature, Entertainers respect different personality types and approaches more and more. Novelty is king for people with the Entertainer personality type, and there\u2019s only so much diversity among fellow Explorer types. Entertainers love touching on intellectual and philosophical subjects, and they seek out a diversity of personality types and perspectives to keep among their friends. But as these friends grind into the details of some esoteric topic about the long-term consequences of faltering European economic output, Entertainers inevitably find their minds wandering, hoping for someone to rush up and say \u201cGuess what just happened!\u201d"}]}

A Protagonist (ENFJ) is a person with the Extraverted , Intuitive , Feeling , and Judging personality traits. These warm, forthright types love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals. Protagonists (ENFJs) feel called to serve a greater purpose in life. Thoughtful and idealistic, these personality types strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. They rarely shy away from an opportunity to do the right thing, even when doing so is far from easy. Protagonists are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring Protagonists a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves. When the whole world is silent, even one voice becomes powerful. MALALA YOUSAFZAI Speaking Up for What\u2019s Right Protagonists tend to be vocal about their values, including authenticity and altruism. When something strikes them as unjust or wrong, they speak up. But they rarely come across as brash or pushy, as their sensitivity and insight guide them to speak in ways that resonate with others. These personality types have an uncanny ability to pick up on people\u2019s underlying motivations and beliefs. At times, they may not even understand how they come to grasp another person\u2019s mind and heart so quickly. These flashes of insight can make Protagonists incredibly persuasive and inspiring communicators. Changing people\u2019s minds is no easy task \u2013 but if anyone can do it, it\u2019s Protagonists. Protagonists\u2019 secret weapon is their purity of intent. Generally speaking, they are motivated by a sincere wish to do the right thing rather than a desire to manipulate or have power over other people. Even when they disagree with someone, Protagonists search for common ground. The result is that people with this personality type can communicate with an eloquence and sensitivity that are nearly impossible to ignore \u2013 particularly when they speak about matters that are close to their hearts. Getting Involved When Protagonists care about someone, they want to help solve that person\u2019s problems \u2013 sometimes at any cost. The good news is that many people are grateful for Protagonists\u2019 assistance and advice. After all, there\u2019s a reason that these personalities have a reputation for helping others improve their lives. Protagonists are genuine, caring people who talk the talk and walk the walk. Nothing makes them happier than motivating other people to do what\u2019s right. But getting involved in other people\u2019s problems isn\u2019t always a recipe for success. Protagonists tend to have a clear vision of what people can or should do in order to better themselves, but not everyone is ready to make those changes. If Protagonists push too hard, their loved ones may feel resentful or unfairly judged. And while this personality type is known for being insightful, even the wisest Protagonists may sometimes misread a situation or unwittingly give bad advice. Leading the Way People with this personality type are devoted altruists, ready to face slings and arrows in order to stand up for the people and ideas that they believe in. This strength of conviction bolsters Protagonists\u2019 innate leadership skills, particularly their ability to guide people to work together in service of the greater good. But their greatest gift might actually be leading by example. In their day-to-day lives, Protagonists reveal how seemingly ordinary situations can be handled with compassion, dedication, and care. For these personalities, even the smallest daily choices and actions \u2013 from how they spend their weekend to what they say to a coworker who is struggling \u2013 can become an opportunity to lead the way to a brighter future."}]}

Wild and Free Exploration and experiences are key philosophies for Entertainer parents \u2013 when their children ask questions, the answer is \u201cLet\u2019s find out!\u201d Overbearing structures and tightly scheduled activities aren\u2019t a big part of Entertainer personalities\u2019 parenting. They\u2019d much rather take things day by day and break up the crust by letting their children explore something new in their own way, something much appreciated by Entertainers\u2019 children. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t any rules \u2013 Entertainers were young once, too! Discipline is far from their strongest suit, but hindsight and maturity have their effects, and Entertainers are often keen to prevent their children from suffering the same hurts and setbacks they themselves experienced. People with the Entertainer personality type are quite sensitive themselves, and expect their children to be respectful and considerate with what rules there are, a point of contention through the teenage years. Entertainers always keep up their end of the bargain though, providing plenty of emotional support. While not especially demanding parents, warm affection and a sense of practicality give Entertainer personalities a very nurturing and encouraging parenting style, filling the gap nicely. When their children declare themselves future astronauts, Entertainers happily build make-believe spaceships, and later use those declarations to help their children focus on their schoolwork and goals. After all, successful astronauts need to know their math!"}]}

They\u2019re nearly always up for a little lighthearted banter \u2013 or a deep, heartfelt, emotional discussion about anything and everything. Generous and giving, Campaigners have much to offer in the realm of friendship. At times, however, they may struggle with a suspicion that they care more about their friends than their friends care about them \u2013 a suspicion that can leave these sociable, warmhearted personalities feeling more than a little lonely. For Campaigners, friendship is an opportunity to see the universe through another person\u2019s eyes. The Adventure of Friendship Imaginative and upbeat, Campaigners know how to transform even the most ordinary moments into a special occasion. And for these personalities, nearly any opportunity to spend time with friends is a special occasion. Campaigners cherish their friends, and they\u2019d hate to take a single moment together for granted. With their trademark good cheer, Campaigners can turn any occasion into an adventure \u2013 an unforgettable dance party, an impromptu cookie-baking contest, or a soul-baring conversation about the state of the world. As you might expect, Campaigners\u2019 sociable energy can be a magnet for other outgoing personality types. But their warmth and sincerity draws all sorts of people out of their shells, and many Campaigners feel drawn to befriend people who are relatively shy or reserved. Attracted to depth and nuance, people with this personality type find it gratifying to watch someone gradually open up and reveal their innermost thoughts and feelings. And with their unique combination of sensitivity and enthusiasm, Campaigners can help quieter friends feel understood and accepted \u2013 and not a little exhilarated. In Too Deep From the outside, it might seem that friendship comes easily to these personality types \u2013 and to some extent, it does. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Campaigners always experience the deep, meaningful relationships that they long for. Some people simply don\u2019t want to open up emotionally in the way that Campaigners crave. Others may turn out to be closed-minded or judgmental in ways that don\u2019t match their values. To Campaigners, it can sometimes seem as if the rest of the world were satisfied with superficial, casual relationships. In these moments, they can\u2019t help but wonder whether their deep longing for human connection is just too much for other people to handle. Ever the idealists, Campaigners may find it difficult to accept that they can\u2019t befriend everyone. Campaigners\u2019 idealism can also cause issues within their close friendships. This personality type is known for going to great lengths to be caring and helpful, and Campaigners take pride in being unfailingly generous with their energy, time, money, attention, and emotions. But, at times, Campaigners may give so much to their friendships that they can\u2019t meet their own needs. Unfortunately, even between the dearest of friends, this sort of imbalance can create resentment and misunderstanding. Making Life Spectacular Fortunately, Campaigners\u2019 emotional sensitivity enables them to respond not only to their friends\u2019 needs but also to their own. Once Campaigners learn to balance their desire to help others with their need to stay true to themselves, they can bring the full strength of their empathy, curiosity, and joy to their friendships. And the adventures that Campaigners share with their friends are the stuff that a good life is made of."}]}

Fun-loving and playful, flexible and understanding, people with the Entrepreneur personality type genuinely enjoy spending time with their children, and know how to make sure everyone is having a good time. Entrepreneurs have a natural curiosity and spontaneity that is perfectly matched to the wonder and insatiable desire to learn that young children have. Freedom to Explore Entrepreneurs love hands-on activities, and their children aren\u2019t left wanting for someone to play catch with, or to help them build a model for school. Sports, hiking, and other practical, hands-on hobbies are all welcomed and encouraged. At the same time, given their aversion to rules and schedules themselves, Entrepreneurs aren\u2019t likely to forcibly enter their children into all manner of clubs and teams. If their kids want to play softball, great \u2013 if not, well, they\u2019ll just find something else to do. Maybe the greatest thing about Entrepreneur parents is that they see their children as equal members of the family. Entrepreneurs give their children freedom, encourage them to use their own judgment (especially with the minor stuff), and to follow their hearts \u2013 to heck with what other people think. Entrepreneur personalities keep a close enough eye on their kids, using that knack for picking up on even the slightest changes in others\u2019 moods and habits, that they can step in with extra guidance when things start to go wrong. Entrepreneurs do have one significant parental challenge though: emotional bonding. Feelings tend to be seen by Entrepreneurs as a bit of an irrational distraction, rather than a tool for expression and connection. If their children happen to be more sensitive, this can be a source of tension between Entrepreneurs and their children. Frank honesty isn\u2019t always the best prescription. Focusing on Connection Still, Entrepreneurs often find that parenthood gives them all the motivation they need to work on their sensitivity and emotional attunement. Through shared activities and experiences, these parents can create healthy, genuine bonds with their children, gaining a deeper knowledge of their children\u2019s unique needs and dreams and way of being in the world. Entrepreneurs have the added benefit of direct and understanding relationships \u2013 their children won\u2019t feel so much like they have to hide their mistakes and challenges, the holy grail of parent-child communication."}]}

Wanting to experience everything there is to experience, people with the Entertainer personality type don\u2019t mind stepping out of their comfort zones when no one else is willing. Original \u2013 Traditions and expectations are secondary to Entertainers, if a consideration at all. Entertainer personalities love to experiment with new styles, and constantly find new ways to stick out in the crowd. Aesthetics and Showmanship \u2013 Not stopping at mere outfits, Entertainers inject artistic creativity into their words and actions, too. Every day is a performance, and Entertainers love to put on a show. Practical \u2013 To Entertainers, the world is meant to be felt and experienced. Truth is stranger than fiction, and Entertainers prefer to see and do than to wax philosophical about \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d. Observant \u2013 With all this focus on the here and now, on doing and acting, it makes sense that Entertainers are naturals when it comes to noticing real, tangible things and changes. Excellent People Skills \u2013 More so than things though, Entertainers love to pay attention to people. They are talkative, witty, and almost never run out of things to discuss. For people with this personality type, happiness and satisfaction stem from the time they spend with the people they enjoy being with. Entertainer Weaknesses Sensitive \u2013 Entertainers (especially Turbulent ones) are strongly emotional, and very vulnerable to criticism \u2013 they can feel like they\u2019ve been backed into a corner, sometimes reacting badly. This is probably Entertainers\u2019 greatest weakness, because it makes it so hard to address any other weaknesses brought to light. Conflict-Averse \u2013 Entertainers sometimes ignore and avoid conflict entirely. They tend to say and do what\u2019s needed to get out of such situations, then move on to something more fun. Easily Bored \u2013 Without constant excitement, Entertainers find ways to create it themselves. Risky behavior, self-indulgence, and the pleasures of the moment over long-term plans are all things Entertainers get into a little too often. Poor Long-Term Planners \u2013 In fact, Entertainer personalities rarely make detailed plans for the future. To them, things come as they come, and they rarely bother with taking the time to lay out steps and consequences, with the belief that they could change at any moment \u2013 even with things that can be planned. Unfocused \u2013 Anything that requires long-term dedication and focus is a particular challenge for Entertainers. In academics, dense, unchanging subjects like Classic Literature are much more difficult than more dynamic, relatable subjects like psychology. The trick for Entertainers is to find day-to-day joy in broader goals, and to tough it out with those tedious things that must be done."}]}

Often seen as model citizens, Executives expect their children to carry that image, continuing the example they\u2019ve set by being polite and respectful \u2013 insubordination is not tolerated. Executives have a very responsibility-oriented life-view, a firm belief in the idea that one does what one can do in order to contribute to the family and community.

Parents with this personality type see it as their duty to provide their children with a secure and comfortable home life \u2013 a stable foundation to help their children grow up to be capable, successful, and happy. But when it comes to parenthood, Defenders aren\u2019t just motivated by a sense of duty \u2013 they are also motivated by love, and the depth and power of this love can be nothing short of amazing. Many people with this personality type feel that parenting is not just a responsibility but a calling, a way for them to use their gifts of altruism, generosity, and patience to guide a beautiful new soul into the world. The Road to Independence Given that this personality type values tradition and guidance, it\u2019s no surprise that many Defenders embrace clearly defined roles for parents and children. Rather than seeing themselves as their children\u2019s peer or best friend, Defender parents view their role, and often rightly so, as that of a loving authority figure \u2013 someone who imparts wisdom and values, gently but firmly teaching their children the difference between right and wrong. Defenders dedicate themselves to ensuring that their children understand the importance of taking responsibility and doing the right thing. It can be challenging for Defender parents when their children, in an effort to assert their independence, push back on this well-intended guidance and support. As part of their development, most children reach a point where they want to test boundaries, experiment with new ways of doing things, and make their own choices \u2013 and that sometimes involves going against their parents\u2019 advice and values. This may not be difficult for Defenders to manage in the early years, but it can become more of a struggle once their children reach adolescence and young adulthood, when the decision-making stakes become much higher. Defenders value stability, and they want to make sure that their children are setting themselves up for the \u201cright\u201d kind of future \u2013 one that includes financial and professional security as well as happiness. If they worry that their children aren\u2019t putting themselves on track for this kind of future, Defender parents can become deeply unsettled or even somewhat controlling. An Abundance of Love Fortunately, Defenders hardly ever lose track of just how much they love their children. It\u2019s true that parents with this personality type may sometimes be heavy-handed in their efforts to steer their children in what they perceive to be a good direction \u2013 but even if their children end up going a different way, that doesn\u2019t mean that Defenders will stop loving them or trying to help them find a way to happiness. Defender parents lead with their hearts, and those hearts have more than enough room to love and accept their children as they are. The truth is that parenting is far from easy for any personality type \u2013 not if they\u2019re doing it right. That said, Defenders have the advantage of being not just caring but also thoughtful and responsible in how they administer that care. Often seen as ideal parents, people with the Defender personality type are able to offer their children stability, security, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 an abundance of love and support."}]}

It\u2019s no surprise, then, that choosing a career path can leave people with this personality type feeling overwhelmed or scattered. They may feel pulled in multiple directions, uncertain of how to honor their passions and keep their options open while pulling in a steady paycheck. The good news? Campaigners can use their boundless curiosity and imagination to propel themselves forward in nearly any profession. When selecting a career, Campaigners tend to find that their main issue isn\u2019t a lack of options. It\u2019s that there are just so many fascinating and worthy possibilities to explore. What Works for Campaigners Campaigners have a way of brightening the world around them \u2013 including their workplaces. With the right mindset, these personalities can find pleasure and gratification in nearly any job. They may even welcome the challenge of breaking through a grumpy coworker\u2019s shell, making harried customers smile, or boosting the morale of a less-than-cheerful workplace. That said, Campaigners are more likely to be fulfilled by work that meets certain criteria. First, they need to believe that what they do on a daily basis aligns with their core values. Second, most people with this personality type feel best in jobs that use \u2013 and build on \u2013 their talents. It can be hard for Campaigners to maintain motivation in a job that doesn\u2019t enable them to help people or create community in some way. These personality types may feel that something is missing if they take on a career that doesn\u2019t allow them to use and improve their people skills. Campaigners also tend to be most motivated in careers that offer learning opportunities and room for creativity \u2013 including the opportunity to experiment with side projects that catch their interest. This explains why many Campaigners are drawn to careers in nonprofits, public service, counseling, education, customer or public relations, hospitality, media and entertainment, and the service industry. Jobs in social media and communications can be an excellent fit for them as well, allowing them to balance creativity with a sense of human connection. Campaigners may also gravitate toward scientific and technical fields where they can have a positive impact, such as human health and environmental science. Letting Creativity Prevail For people with this personality type, few things are as demoralizing as a job where every day is the same. Predictability and repetition can make Campaigners feel not only bored but also a little disheartened. Although they benefit from a degree of structure and accountability, they may lose steam in work environments that rely on strict regimentation and hierarchy. Campaigners crave variety, and they love to ask questions. To maintain motivation, they need to feel as if they\u2019re pushing boundaries and exploring new ideas. Any job that expects them to keep quiet and follow protocol is effectively turning two of Campaigners\u2019 greatest strengths into liabilities. Fortunately, Campaigners\u2019 irrepressible creativity is an asset in the majority of workplaces. With their enthusiasm and empathy, these personalities can turn each workday into an opportunity to learn something new and make the world just a little better \u2013 and they wouldn\u2019t have it any other way."}]}

People with this personality type may seem cerebral and reserved, but once they let their guard down, they have a playful, creative side as well. In their relationships, Logicians can use their ingenuity to keep things fresh and come up with clever, unexpected ways to make their partners feel special. As Introverts, Logicians appreciate alone time, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t crave companionship. For people with this personality type, the ideal romantic partner isn\u2019t just someone to pass the time with but an equal who can challenge their ideas. Logicians want to spend their life in pursuit of learning and growth. They hope that the person they love will not just share this mission but also actively encourage it. Finding a relationship that meets these standards isn\u2019t always easy for these personalities. Logicians may drag their feet when it comes to going out into the world and meeting new people. And even when they do have an interest in someone, it can take them a while to work up the will to risk rejection and ask that person out. Being the center of attention in an emotionally delicate situation isn\u2019t easy for anyone, but especially not for Logicians. A Genuine Connection From the start, Logicians take their relationships seriously. When they finally meet a partner they connect with on a real level \u2013 someone whose mind they respect and whose company they enjoy \u2013 these personalities know better than to take it for granted. Even early in the dating phase, Logicians are unusually direct and honest. They don\u2019t see the point of playing games, and while they can be quiet, they aren\u2019t coy. People with this personality type rarely filter their opinions, and they encourage their partners to be frank with them as well. For many Logicians, being up front isn\u2019t a sign of rudeness or bad manners \u2013 instead, it\u2019s a point of pride, not to mention a way to avoid misunderstandings. As their relationships progress, Logicians\u2019 daily needs prove simple. Gifts, surprises, complex social plans, and elaborate date nights are all fairly unimportant to them. Unfortunately, even if their partner does want these things, it may not even occur to Logicians to plan them out. These personalities may need to put special effort and attention into learning how to express their affection in a way that resonates with their significant other. Otherwise, their partner may feel ignored, underappreciated, or even unloved. On the plus side, Logicians can turn this situation into an opportunity to put their trademark ingenuity to good use. Navigating Conflict Few people love conflict, but Logicians are especially prone to shutting down when emotional disagreements arise. Rather than slowing down and really listening, they may use their powers of logic to try to prove their partner wrong. Alternatively, they might offer easy, logical solutions, not wanting to delve into the messiness of deeper issues and feelings. When it comes to conflict, Logicians can be guilty of a certain willful ignorance. They may be tempted to set aside their partner\u2019s feelings, and their own, for far too long. As they mature, Logicians often learn that people\u2019s emotional needs (including their own) are real and valid. For a personality type that loves rationality, this isn\u2019t always the easiest of lessons. But this awareness can help Logicians rise to the challenges that all long-term relationships encounter. Talking about feelings may not come naturally to them, but Logicians can learn to find emotional common ground with their partner, even in moments of disagreement. The Irrationality of Joy Logicians tend to live in the world of thought. Romantic relationships can help break them out of their own mind, allowing them to experience the fullness of joy and pleasure in the present moment. This experience can be transformational, revealing strengths, traits, and desires that Logicians hadn\u2019t known lay within them. With their creative, vivid imagination, Logicians can make for surprisingly enthusiastic and passionate partners, capable of expanding their horizons in ways that serve their relationship, without ever losing their sense of self."}]}

Naturally, they don\u2019t spare any of this freshness and energy when dating. For people with the Entertainer personality type, relationships aren\u2019t about slowly building foundations for the future, or planning out a life \u2013 they are bubbling, unpredictable things to be enjoyed for as long as there\u2019s enjoyment to be had. The Spark of Love Of course, when that enjoyment does burn out, it\u2019s gone. Entertainers reevaluate their situations and commitments constantly, regardless of professions of love and dedication today. If a week later they just don\u2019t feel the same, that\u2019s it, and Entertainer personalities have no problem seriously considering breaking things off. While Entertainers can be willing to work on their relationships rather than swap them out, it takes a great deal of maturity and experience for them to realize that it can be worth the bother. While they do last though, relationships with Entertainers are simply unforgettable. People with this personality type always have some new and exciting activity up their sleeves, and they genuinely enjoy spending each moment with their partners. Entertainers enjoy physical intimacy immensely, and they prove themselves affectionate, inquisitive, and open-minded lovers who love to share pleasure with willing and reciprocative partners. Conversation with Entertainers is similar, focusing on fun, sometimes quirky subjects rather than deep, soul-searching expressions. The past and the future, the sciences and politics, and long-term plans and commitments are all routinely ignored by Entertainer personalities. They slow things down and add too much weight to Entertainers\u2019 freewheeling style. Entertainers happily chat about just about anything or anyone that comes to mind, but won\u2019t have a topic forced. Highly emotional people, and sensitive, Entertainers respond poorly to outside \u201csuggestions\u201d on how to manage their love lives. They respond even worse if criticisms come from their partners, and trying to take emotions out of the picture by telling Entertainers to \u201cnot take this personally\u201d isn\u2019t helpful either. Handling these situations better is a definite area for improvement for Entertainers, as there are entire dating strategies (pretty distasteful, manipulative ones) that revolve around exploiting this very trait. On the other hand, the issue can be a lack of criticism at all. Entertainers value social input a lot, and are almost as affected by their friends\u2019 opinions of their dating partners as their own. Since Entertainers are attracted to people who share their attitudes, whether dating partners or friends, this can leave them in an echo chamber that only tells them what they want to hear, reinforcing immature behaviors. A Joyful Heart All of these tendencies can really come back to haunt people with the Entertainer personality type later on. Entertainers\u2019 tendency to avoid promises and commitments and jump from partner to partner sabotages necessary long-term goals like retirement planning. Building real relationships takes time and conscious effort. Luckily, Entertainers are incredibly likeable people who enjoy life\u2019s small pleasures, and hardly want for diversity in their partners. Enthusiastic and affectionate, with a pure and down-to-earth love that just takes things at face value, Entertainers are fortunate that they take the time to find someone they truly enjoy being with every day, rather than settling too soon for stability over happiness, only to lose both."}]}

A Consul (ESFJ) is a person with the Extraverted , Observant , Feeling , and Judging personality traits. They are attentive and people-focused, and they enjoy taking part in their social community. Their achievements are guided by decisive values, and they willingly offer guidance to others. Encourage, lift, and strengthen one another. For the positive energy spread to one will be felt by us all. Deborah Day For Consuls, life is sweetest when it\u2019s shared with others. People with this personality type form the bedrock of many communities, opening their homes \u2013 and their hearts \u2013 to friends, loved ones, and neighbors. This doesn\u2019t mean that Consuls like everyone, or that they\u2019re saints. But Consuls do believe in the power of hospitality and good manners, and they tend to feel a sense of duty to those around them. Generous and reliable, people with this personality type often take it upon themselves \u2013 in ways both large and small \u2013 to hold their families and their communities together. Consuls have a talent for making the people in their lives feel supported, cared for, and secure. The Beauty of a Responsible Life Consuls are altruists. They take seriously their responsibilities to give back, serve others, and do the right thing. And Consuls believe that there is a clear right thing to do in nearly every situation. While some personality types adopt a more lenient, live-and-let-live attitude, Consuls may find it difficult not to judge when someone takes a path that strikes them as misguided. As a result, Consuls often struggle to accept it when someone \u2013 particularly someone they care about \u2013 disagrees with them. Consuls have a clear moral compass \u2013 and it can be nothing short of baffling to them when other people\u2019s actions don\u2019t align with it. With their definite views on right and wrong, Consuls tend to be on the opinionated side. But these opinions aren\u2019t arbitrary \u2013 they\u2019re often based on a deep respect for tradition. Consuls know that everything they do affects someone else, and they trust that established laws, protocols, and social norms will help them navigate their everyday lives in a way that is considerate and responsible toward others. Building Relationships That Last Supportive and outgoing, Consuls can always be spotted at a party \u2013 they\u2019re the ones fluttering around making sure that everyone else is having a good time! But make no mistake: Consuls don\u2019t just breeze through other people\u2019s lives. Loyal to the core, they build lasting relationships, and they can be counted on to show up whenever a helping hand \u2013 or a listening ear \u2013 is needed. Consuls rarely miss a birthday or holiday. Devoted to their relationships, they commit even the smallest details of their friends\u2019 and loved ones\u2019 lives to memory. With their love of order and structure, Consuls prefer planned events to open-ended activities or spontaneous get-togethers \u2013 and they\u2019re happy to host in order to ensure that everything goes smoothly. People with this personality type put a great deal of energy into making other people feel special and celebrated, and they may take it personally when someone doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate their efforts. For many people with the Consul personality type, one of life\u2019s greatest challenges is accepting that they can\u2019t control anyone else\u2019s thoughts or behavior \u2013 not even those who are nearest and dearest to them. Fortunately, Consuls can find peace and fulfillment by focusing on what they do best: setting an example of care, consideration, and responsibility \u2013 and bringing people together in the process."}]}

Sensitive yet firm, Consul parents are able to establish rules and authority without being entirely overbearing, using their compassion and support to smooth over the occasional miscommunication or difference of opinion. Having children is often the culmination of Consuls\u2019 life goals, and they cherish every moment of it. From the start, Consuls try to ensure that their children feel safe and happy. People with the Consul personality type enjoy the support they are able to give their infants, who are utterly dependent on their care. Family being as important as it is to Consuls, this is an incredibly rewarding start to the relationship. Protective or Over-Protective? As their children grow and begin to explore more, Consuls\u2019 love and care grows with them, but often becomes overprotective. Consuls may not just keep their children safe physically, but also socially, by arranging play dates, camps and other activities so much that their children aren\u2019t free to make the blunders that lead to emotional growth and social independence. Consuls value harmony and stability highly, and it\u2019s often the case that they try to use indirect pressure to try to teach life\u2019s lessons. When they are forced into a confrontation by their children\u2019s blatant wrong-doing though, Consul parents step in firmly, and expect their words to be respected. Believers in traditional roles, Consul parents view the parent-child relationship in black and white terms, with their authority as final. The Gift of Independence As their children grow into adolescence and begin to push away from their parents, Consuls can take this transition personally. Feeling like they are losing their children, Consul personalities sometimes try to prolong their dependence as long as possible. It\u2019s important to remember that when grown children leave the home, it\u2019s because their parents were successful in preparing them for the next phase of their lives, an accomplishment Consuls can be proud of. Consuls\u2019 children will always appreciate the sensitivity and warmth that they were raised with, and as time goes on and they have their own children, they will cherish the fact that those children have the benefit of grandparents who love and care for them unconditionally."}]}

Boldness is a mark of this personality type. But then we split the Identities . We soon find that Assertive Entrepreneurs (ESTP-A) and Turbulent Entrepreneurs (ESTP-T) express their shared features in clearly different ways. Let\u2019s look at a few areas where our research tells us they\u2019re different. Sense of Self 65% of Assertive Entrepreneurs said they make mistakes far less often than other people, compared to 42% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs. Confidence is a key quality of the Assertive Identity for all personality types. It\u2019s no different for Assertive Entrepreneurs. Many of them see themselves as making fewer mistakes than other people. Does this mean that they are less prone to making errors? That may be, but it\u2019s not necessarily so. Identity is about how personality types see themselves, and that can be subjective \u2013 with people seeing what they expect to see. The same holds for Turbulent Entrepreneurs as well. They may or may not make more mistakes than Assertive Entrepreneurs. But the self-doubt that is part of the Turbulent package makes them less inclined to view themselves as making far fewer mistakes than other people. Their self-talk generally involves less certainty. 65% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs said they are constantly worried about saying or doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, compared to 21% of Assertive Entrepreneurs. Both types of Entrepreneur tend to see themselves among the bravest of personality types. Yet there is a significant difference in the level of boldness between the two. Since they don\u2019t have as much fear of making mistakes and doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, Assertive Entrepreneurs are likely to go forward with less hesitation. But there is a bright side to Turbulent Entrepreneurs\u2019 relative lack of self-assurance. Worry often expresses itself one of two ways: anxious immobility or a drive to do things carefully enough to avoid problems. The first reaction to worry can be resolved with some effort. The second can be used to create a more successful outcome by encouraging a more careful approach \u2013 at least when compared to Assertive Entrepreneurs. The second option fits Entrepreneurs\u2019 action-oriented core personality traits better. A motivated-by-worry mind-set can lead Turbulent Entrepreneurs to want to be more thorough, even if they sometimes want to avoid problems or are easily rattled. 72% of Assertive Entrepreneurs said that if a task is difficult, they feel even more motivated to finish it, compared to 44% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs. Assertive Entrepreneurs are more likely to see things as a challenge rather than a difficulty when things go wrong or become harder. Most say an obstacle increases their motivation. Turbulent Entrepreneurs are less likely to regard a struggle as a motivating factor. They are even more likely to ignore a problem, hoping it will go away. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that every Turbulent Entrepreneur buries their head in the sand in the face of adversity when all is said and done. That would go against the fundamental traits of these personality types. They simply view challenges in a less favorable light, and Turbulent Entrepreneurs are typically prone to impatience when they encounter frustrations. 57% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs agreed that it\u2019s hard for them to make up their minds, even about small things like what to eat or wear, compared to 23% of Assertive Entrepreneurs. More Turbulent Entrepreneurs are likely to believe that life is too complicated in these modern times. These personalities also see themselves as less decisive when considering smaller matters. Evaluating important matters seems to be a little easier for them. But, even with weightier decisions, they appear less at ease than their Assertive cousins. This sense of being weighed down by the complexity of modern life and small choices may speak to a lack of confidence. Turbulent Entrepreneurs may feel that they are not able to deal with such things adequately. Facing too many options can sometimes be complicated for Turbulent personality types with the Prospecting trait. This likely holds true for Turbulent Entrepreneurs as well. Social Life and Emotions 68% of Assertive Entrepreneurs said people rarely upset them, compared to 26% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs. Assertive individuals are often on their own, to the point that the opinions of others are not so important. However, Entrepreneurs\u2019 Extraversion may somewhat mute this independence in the interest of maintaining social connections. They may need to take what others think seriously in order to do so. Still, Assertive Entrepreneurs, needing the say-so of others less, are more socially relaxed than Turbulent Entrepreneurs. 57% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs agreed that it\u2019s hard for them to make decisions without advice from someone close to them, compared to 30% of Assertive Entrepreneurs. Turbulent Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are more interested in what others feel and think. Perhaps a good metaphor for this is that they are more self-conscious about their appearance around other people. Also, they are more likely to want advice from others. In general, they need people more. This need can make Turbulent Entrepreneurs less likely to act swiftly. Their exceedingly dynamic core personality traits can act as a counterbalance to this. But, still, compared to Assertive Entrepreneurs, opinions are essential to them, and they are likely to be more cautious and to seek a positive response from others more actively. 71% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs said their own emotional reactions often catch them off guard, compared to 30% of Assertive Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are a mixed bag emotionally, and those with this personality type aren\u2019t likely to see themselves as emotional in a quieter sense. Dealing with feelings isn\u2019t a primary strength for them, nor are emotions quickly processed. Yet these personalities also indicate that they can be emotionally expressive when that is called for. They may see something useful in letting people know the way they feel about things. However, there seems to be a sense of less control of emotions among Turbulent Entrepreneurs. Most say they are surprised at their own reactions. They are more likely to need some time to compose themselves when they encounter a stressful situation. 75% of Turbulent Entrepreneurs said that, in a stressful situation, they need some time to pull themselves together, compared to 32% of Assertive Entrepreneurs. Being a Thinking personality type with self-doubts, Turbulent Entrepreneurs may not be comfortable when an emotional or stressful event appears suddenly. They may feel somewhat scattered in such situations. Turbulent Entrepreneurs may need to take a breath and have a chance to think before they feel comfortable. Assertive Entrepreneurs are also Thinking personalities \u2013 only without as much self-doubt. Their confidence likely allows them to believe that they can manage any spontaneous situation, whether it\u2019s good or bad. For them, their competence is a safe bet. This self-assurance enables them to remain calm or to recover and respond quickly in the face of a distressing situation. However, there is such a thing as too much confidence, and it can sometimes result in impulsive and ill-considered responses that may not be helpful. Summary Assertive Entrepreneurs are more likely to see themselves as capable, based primarily on their confidence. Turbulent Entrepreneurs do not share the same level of confidence, but their relative level of self-doubt can make them more careful in their lives when compared to Assertive Entrepreneurs. While both types of Entrepreneur generally see themselves as one of the more courageous personality types, Turbulent Entrepreneurs are likely not as bold as their counterparts. However, their hesitation may save them from making impulsive mistakes. Small matters and decisions can be difficult for Turbulent Entrepreneurs. These matters may offer too many choices for them. Assertive Entrepreneurs see challenges as more motivating than Turbulent Entrepreneurs, but it would be inaccurate to say that Turbulent Entrepreneurs don\u2019t get the job done despite obstacles. Assertive Entrepreneurs are likely to be more socially relaxed because people\u2019s opinions carry less weight with them. Turbulent Entrepreneurs are more likely to see the views of others as significant and may act accordingly. Turbulent Entrepreneurs feel less control over their emotions, and their feelings often surprise them. The Different Expressions of the Gregarious Entrepreneur When someone is as outgoing as those with the Entrepreneur personality type tend to be, the Identity differences between the two types are likely to be very evident. Assertive Entrepreneurs are friendly and gregarious. But they may look slightly careless and perhaps even appear somewhat superficially involved. Turbulent Entrepreneurs may be just as friendly and gregarious, but they might also come across as too needy. And so it goes with Identities \u2013 common traits that each type of Entrepreneur expresses in different ways."}]}

Virtuoso personalities have a talent for conserving their energy for just such an occasion, and can tackle such a laundry list with surprising enthusiasm. Their tasks do need to be hands-on though \u2013 if the items all start with \u201cCome up with a strategy to...\u201d, it\u2019s probably better to find an Analyst type. Virtuoso Colleagues Virtuosos are often much more liked by their colleagues than they would expect. Quiet and reserved, people with this personality type usually need a little physical space, but at the same time enjoy peeking in on others\u2019 work to see if there\u2019s anything interesting going on. Not naturally emotional or empathetic, Virtuosos have a blunt way of communicating that can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. Yet, Virtuosos combine this rationalism and reserve with a sense of spontaneity that, among other things, creates a lighthearted sense of \u201cdo unto others\u201d fairness. Turnabout is always fair play, and the odd prank, and the retaliation, are usually enjoyed by all. Virtuosos have a great sense of humor, if sometimes a little risqu\u00e9, and are not only resistant to workplace conflicts, but are great at defusing them with a well-placed joke that puts it all into perspective. Virtuoso Managers Virtuoso managers treat their subordinates as they\u2019d like to be treated: with minimal talking and loose boundaries. Virtuosos aren\u2019t big on chattiness or emotional expression, and more sensitive types may see them as cold and distant \u2013 effusive praise and back-slapping just isn\u2019t in Virtuosos\u2019 nature. In fact, there isn\u2019t likely to be a lot of feedback at all from Virtuoso managers, good or bad. But when problems do arise, they are great listeners who devise practical, fair, and impartial solutions."}]}

People with this personality type continuously scour their surroundings in search of the new and beautiful. When we take it a bit further and explore their Identities , we see two expressions of what it means to be an Adventurer. Once divided, the two types become two different shades of the same color on the Adventurer palette. Let\u2019s look at what our research says about the differences between Assertive Adventurers (ISFP-A) and Turbulent Adventurers (ISFP-T). A Lion or a House Cat? 59% of Assertive Adventurers say they would rather be a lion in the wild than a house cat, compared to 23% of Turbulent Adventurers. \u201cWOULD YOU RATHER\u2026\u201d SURVEY The lion or the house cat? It\u2019s a close metaphor for the differences between Assertive and Turbulent Adventurer personalities. Assertive Adventurers look nearly like Extraverts in their robust expression of spontaneity and curiosity. They tend to roar when compared to their Turbulent counterparts. But house cats are not the opposite of lions. They are their more cautious cousins. In their quieter way, Turbulent Adventurers are just as attracted to the new, interesting, and beautiful as their Assertive counterparts. As Introverted personalities, both types of Adventurers need time to recharge after contact with the outside world. Symbolically, Assertive Adventurers likely wander farther away from their home bases when exploring the world and likely engage it more. Turbulent Adventurers are just as likely to explore, just a little closer to the familiar and deeper within their comfort zones. 72% of Assertive Adventurers consider themselves unique and/or special, compared to 39% of Turbulent Adventurers. \u201cSELF-CONFIDENCE\u201d SURVEY Assertive Adventurers usually feel sure about what they offer the world. These personalities embrace that their contribution is something distinct and maybe even sometimes worthy of notice. This notion likely extends to how they think about themselves. Turbulent Adventurers may be less sure about their contributions. They may question the worthiness of their ideas and results. Where the undoubting Assertive Adventurers feel unique and special, these same \u201cvirtues\u201d may translate in Turbulent Adventurers as something to feel uncertain about. Their doubts may make any breakthrough successes hard to accept. Living in the Moment Can Be Stressful Too 64% of Assertive Adventurers feel like they effectively manage stress, compared to 24% of Turbulent Adventurers. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Nearly two-thirds of Assertive Adventurers believe they handle stress well. In all their self-assurance, they may see such pressure as something that doesn\u2019t impact their lives much because they feel that they can handle it. They may even shrug such challenges off. This disregard for stressful things allows these personalities to move forward worry-free and probably more boldly. But they may also overly minimize the significance of their stressors. Assertive Adventurers may not always attend to the problems they should. Turbulent Adventurers are less likely to feel competent in the face of stress. At first glance, this might appear negative. But whenever these personalities encounter something that feels stressful, their lack of confidence is likely to cause them to be more concerned about it \u2013 perhaps even to feel dread because of it. These feelings may bring about a heightened awareness of actual or potential problems. If they aren\u2019t overwhelmed by these difficulties, they may find solutions sooner than their Assertive counterparts. 67% of Turbulent Adventurers say their responsibilities often overwhelm them, compared to 45% of Assertive Adventurers. \u201cRESPONSIBILITY\u201d SURVEY Similarly, Assertive Adventurers feel more in control of their responsibilities. When people are confident, they are likely to believe they can easily handle the tasks in their lives. As with stress, uncertain Turbulent Adventurers may feel uneasiness about their responsibilities, but this uneasiness may motivate them to be more cautious and perhaps even to perform more meticulously. Self-Regard, Emotions, and Other People 74% of Assertive Adventurers feel like they have control over their emotions, compared to 32% of Turbulent Adventurers. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY Assertive and Turbulent Adventurers obviously share the Feeling personality trait. This trait plays a significant role in how Feeling types make decisions. If Adventurers have a sense that they control their emotions, they are more likely to feel as though they also control their resolve. Otherwise, with shifting emotions, their possible choices can become moving targets. Assertive Adventurer personalities are likely to feel more like the masters of their ships because of the higher likelihood that they will feel in control of their emotions. Alternatively, Turbulent Adventurers are less likely to think that they are in charge of their feelings. If this is more than just the way they see themselves, they may be more indecisive as their emotions fluctuate. 83% of Assertive Adventurers say they feel comfortable with themselves, compared to 57% of Turbulent Adventurers. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Adventurers are just as likely as not to have a positive sense of self. They tend to be more comfortable with themselves than average Turbulent individuals of other personality types. This almost fifty-fifty likelihood is perhaps because of their fierce independence. They are a little more likely to measure themselves mostly by themselves. However, as we\u2019ll see later, that doesn\u2019t mean that Turbulent Adventurers feel no pressure from others. But their independence may give them the space they need to approach more closely the person they think they should be. For a Turbulent personality type, they are relatively less tethered to the judgments of others \u2013 although not completely. Despite this, the difference between Assertiveness and Turbulence remains. Most Assertive Adventurers are significantly more comfortable with themselves than Turbulent Adventurers. Their Assertive confidence extends in all directions. 67% of Turbulent Adventurers say they feel pressured to live up to a certain standard (home, car, salary), compared to 42% of Assertive Adventurers. \u201cSOCIAL PRESSURES\u201d SURVEY However, societal pressures still seem to influence many Adventurer personalities. Standard scorecards that pinpoint who is doing well in a community carry more weight among Turbulent Adventurers than they do among Assertive Adventurers. This attention to outside standards might seem to rob them of the freedom that fuels some of their better qualities. But a moderate dose of keeping up social standards can also keep Turbulent Adventurers connected to the people in their lives. It may keep them in the mainstream just enough. Confident people have less need for the approval of others, and Assertive Adventurers are no different. These personalities are less likely to wait around for permission for what to do and when to do it. This freedom naturally streamlines the goals they wish to pursue. But the less back-and-forth with others that Assertive Adventurers need, the less likely they are to create strong ties with those who might otherwise matter to them. Assertive Adventurers may miss out on valuable feedback and ideas. 73% of Assertive Adventurers say they would offer their honest opinion if a friend asked them, \u201cHow do I look?\u201d compared to 50% of Turbulent Adventurers. \u201cMANNERS\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Adventurers are likely a little less independent, but more likely to be open to working on a team or collaborating. They need to know that others approve of them and that the people who matter to them are all right with what they do. Not that either personality variant is likely to be careless with the feelings of others, but Turbulent Adventurers usually play it safer than Assertive Adventurers with the people in their lives. Summary Because of their greater confidence, Assertive Adventurers are likely to feel more adventurous than Turbulent Adventurers. Turbulent Adventurers are more sensitive to stress and can feel overwhelmed easier than Assertive Adventurers. This characteristic can allow them to see little problems before they become big problems. Though Turbulent Adventurers are likely to feel more comfortable with themselves than the average Turbulent personality type, they are still less at ease in their own lives than Assertive Adventurers. Assertive Adventurers are less dependent on the opinions of others than Turbulent Adventurers, but Turbulent Adventurers\u2019 sensitivity may allow them to work better with others and to collaborate. Either Way, It\u2019s Still an Adventure While two shades of the same color are different, they are likely recognizable as the same color. While Assertive and Turbulent Adventurers\u2019 approaches may differ, the type of life and kind of things they value are solidly the same. However, when it comes to personality types, no trait is wasted, and so these nuanced yet contrasting approaches offer something uniquely special to the world."}]}

People with the Entrepreneur personality type think on their feet and are great at making quick decisions in the heat of the moment. At the same time, they\u2019re affable people who always seem to make friends and connections wherever they go. Popularity and solid networking can be huge assets in the working world, and Entrepreneurs nail it. This social intelligence, combined with Entrepreneurs\u2019 natural boldness and improvisational skill, makes sales, business negotiations, marketing, even acting \u2013 any tense, competitive environment \u2013 a great fit. Entrepreneur personalities trust themselves to make the right call. Risks, big and small, are a part of life, and Entrepreneurs don\u2019t sit around waiting for some boss at the top to tell them what to do. This can get Entrepreneurs into trouble, but often enough it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s needed, and can boost them up the career ladder just as well. It\u2019s hard to imagine Entrepreneurs choosing secure but boring jobs over less stable but more exciting careers. Restrictions, rules, highly structured environments \u2013 these are great ways to drive Entrepreneurs crazy. People with this personality type live life on their own terms, and this makes them brilliant business people and freelancers. These roles also allow them to delegate the more tedious aspects of work, the accounting, meticulous research and so forth, to those better suited. Entrepreneurs are curious, energetic people with a taste for action. There are those who analyze and manage the logistics of public safety resource distribution, and there are those who drive the ambulances, patrol the streets, and save lives with their own two hands \u2013 Entrepreneur personalities are the latter. They are highly observant yet impatient, enabling them to take in the whole of a situation at a glance, and act. Any emergency response role is great for Entrepreneurs, whether it be as paramedics, police officers, or soldiers. The Thrill of the Game This quality of living in the moment and craving immediate results for their efforts translates well into another field: sports. The thrill of competition, of pushing themselves to the physical limit to rack up just one more point for the win can have no comparison for Entrepreneurs. Whether they are on the field as athletes themselves, coaching from the sidelines or commentating from high above, people with the Entrepreneur personality type revel in well-honed team effort and a well-executed plan, and any of these positions makes a fine line of work for them."}]}

A Mediator (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted , Intuitive , Feeling , and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do. Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity \u2013 Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them. Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique. All that is gold does not glitter; not all those who wander are lost; the old that is strong does not wither; deep roots are not reached by the frost. J. R. R. TOLKIEN The Gift of Empathy Mediators share a sincere curiosity about the depths of human nature. Introspective to the core, they\u2019re exquisitely attuned to their own thoughts and feelings, but they yearn to understand the people around them as well. Mediators are compassionate and nonjudgmental, always willing to hear another person\u2019s story. When someone opens up to them or turns to them for comfort, they feel honored to listen and be of help. For Mediators, an ideal relationship of any kind is one in which both people feel comfortable sharing not just their wildest hopes and dreams but also their secret fears and vulnerabilities. Empathy is among this personality type\u2019s greatest gifts, but at times it can be a liability. The troubles of the world weigh heavily on Mediators\u2019 shoulders, and these personalities can be vulnerable to internalizing other people\u2019s negative moods or mindsets. Unless they learn to set boundaries, Mediators may feel overwhelmed by just how many wrongs there are that need to be set right. Speaking Their Truth Few things make Mediators more uneasy than pretending to be someone they aren\u2019t. With their sensitivity and their commitment to authenticity, people with this personality type tend to crave opportunities for creative self-expression. It comes as no surprise, then, that many famous Mediators are poets, writers, actors, and artists. They can\u2019t help but muse about the meaning and purpose of life, dreaming up all sorts of stories, ideas, and possibilities along the way. Mediators have a talent for self-expression. They may reveal their innermost thoughts and secrets through metaphors and fictional characters. Through these imaginative landscapes, Mediators can explore their own inner nature as well as their place in the world. While this is a beautiful trait, these personalities sometimes show a tendency to daydream and fantasize rather than take action. To avoid feeling frustrated, unfulfilled, or incapable, Mediators need to make sure that they take steps to turn their dreams and ideas into reality. In Search of a Calling People with this personality type tend to feel directionless or stuck until they connect with a sense of purpose for their lives. For many Mediators, this purpose has something to do with uplifting others and their ability to feel other people\u2019s suffering as if it were their own. While Mediators want to help everyone, they need to focus their energy and efforts \u2013 otherwise, they can end up exhausted. Fortunately, like flowers in the spring, Mediators\u2019 creativity and idealism can bloom even after the darkest of seasons. Although they know the world will never be perfect, Mediators still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why these personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go."}]}

People with the Commander personality type are in it to win, and will gladly take leading roles in relationships from the start, assuming personal responsibility for how smoothly things go and working actively to ensure a mutually rewarding experience. Romantic relationships are a serious business, and Commanders are in it for the long haul. Taking the Lead This sense of personal responsibility means that Commanders put a lot of energy into their relationships, and they show their creativity by always having something new on the agenda to keep things interesting, especially in the dating phase. At the same time though, Commander personalities keep their eyes on the long term, and if they determine that a relationship is heading towards a dead end, they will cut their losses and move on in what will seem to their partner an abrupt end to the attention they had been receiving. This occasional ruthlessness with personal relationships is Commanders\u2019 primary weakness, and if they aren\u2019t careful they can develop quite the reputation. Sensing others\u2019 feelings and emotions will never be a comfortable skill for Commanders, but it is critical that they work consciously to develop it, both for their partners\u2019 sake and for their own healthy emotional expression. If they don\u2019t, they risk dominating and overruling their partners, and this insensitivity can easily break a relationship, especially early on. Loving Boldly But as all goes well in the dating phase and a future is deemed viable, people with the Commander personality type continue to impress with their creativity and energy. Their authentic confidence makes Commanders\u2019 sex life dynamic to say the least, and they often push to explore new ways to express their affection with imaginative enthusiasm. Yet Commanders tend to have these innovations planned in advance, with some structure and predictability to their sex lives, leaving the true spontaneity to those less organized personality types. Commanders are extremely growth-oriented, and will seize any opportunity to improve themselves, listening to and acting on criticisms, so long as they are logical ones, and always striving to improve their knowledge. At the same time, Commanders expect this of their partners, and it is surprising to them that others don\u2019t always share this attitude. Still more surprising to Commander personalities is others\u2019 active efforts to avoid these tense situations. Commanders in particular would do well to remember that their approach is just one angle of a multi-faceted spectrum of alternatives. While Commanders may view criticism as the most efficient route (and they\u2019re often right), they should bear in mind that their partners may be more interested in emotional support and growth, an area of self-improvement that Commanders themselves too often avoid. As with most things, balance is key, and Commanders should strive to meet their partners half-way, whatever their needs, be it through honest criticisms or steady emotional support and praise. As with other Analyst types, Commanders\u2019 best matches are with other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits to create more balance in the relationship. Mature Commanders are able to recognize and adapt to the needs of their partners, and know that even the most rational individuals have emotional needs that must be met. Fortunately the same logic that dismisses emotions is also able to recognize that a conciliatory attitude can be the best tool to get the job done. With their strong senses of responsibility and dedication, people with the Commander personality type are sure to make this effort, resulting in long-lasting, satisfying relationships."}]}

People with the Entertainer personality type are able to take a social and relaxed attitude and use it to get everyone else on board with practical tasks that just need to get done. The more freedom Entertainers have to meet these needs, the better the results, so long as they know what the goal is, and there\u2019s hardly a better personality type to have around in a dynamic, hectic work environment. Entertainer Subordinates As subordinates, Entertainers thrive on change and new ideas, and loathe repetitive and strictly defined tasks. Entertainer personalities\u2019 managers find willing and able experimenters who can brainstorm, quickly grasp new methods, and actually put those methods to practical use \u2013 so long as Entertainers have a little leeway apply their own creative style. Changes may take a few tries though, as Entertainers can be forgetful in the heat of the moment, and can get more caught up in trying to get quick returns. Entertainers give honest feedback on whether things make sense, but are quite sensitive to others\u2019 criticism of their own habits. Under fire, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) become defensive and are easily upset. But in the end, if they believe that the criticism comes from an honest intent to help, not hurt, Entertainers take it to heart. The biggest struggle for Entertainers in subordinate positions is that they value freedom and independence far more than safety and security \u2013 if their conditions aren\u2019t met, they\u2019re as likely to leave as make do. Entertainer Colleagues If anyone can make friends with their colleagues and keep tension at bay within their team, it\u2019s Entertainers. A fun atmosphere is important, and people with the Entertainer personality type use their strong observational and social skills to bring everyone together, shifting a souring mood if need be. Entertainers rarely want for ideas on how to make this happen, happily organizing events and activities inside and outside the workplace. Entertainers\u2019 spontaneity, wit, and enthusiasm have no equal. Entertainer Managers As managers, Entertainers do everything they can to pump energy and fun into the day-to-day work that needs to be done. Entertainer personalities enjoy being the center of attention, and even more so to feel like they\u2019re needed and appreciated. Jumping into the thick of the work and applying themselves to anything they\u2019d ask their subordinates to do is something Entertainers consider part of the job. Authority and social status are secondary to feeling like they\u2019re an important part of a team that gets the job done. Entertainers are great at noticing others\u2019 moods, and there are few personality types better at preventing conflict and encouraging relaxed, enjoyable workplaces. Subordinates are always welcome to speak their minds, and people with this personality type are always happy to hear others out, especially if something is upsetting them. Entertainers\u2019 ability to relate to others and think on their feet makes them resourceful and inspiring leaders."}]}

The last thing people with the Debater personality type want to hear is \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d, not unless they have absolutely earned the distinction in a heated round of intellectual debate. If they\u2019re wrong, Debaters want to be told so, and they want every detail of the faults in their logic to be laid bare, partly in their quest for oftentimes arbitrary truth, and partly just so they have to work to defend that logic with counterpoint and parry. It\u2019s often easy for Debaters to test compatibility with a potential friend \u2013 they just need to test combatability. Debater personalities are quick-witted, and their primary means of expressing this is in the form of arguments and discussions, where they will easily spend an entire evening debating an idea they may not even believe in. The epitome of Debaters\u2019 friendships is when someone can hold their ground in these arbitrary debates with valid, rational arguments. These debates are never taken personally, no matter how heated they become or how striking the disagreement. Much as an athlete competes for the physical exertion and the spirit of competition itself, Debaters debate for the sake intellectual stimulation and for the debate itself, and even in overwhelming victory or crushing defeat, it\u2019s never about dominance, only inspiration to try harder next time. Never a Dull Moment They know how to relax and have fun too, it\u2019s just that \u201cfun\u201d to Debaters \u2013 a bottle of wine and a discussion about the causes of and solutions to the European migrant crisis \u2013 could be described as \u201can evening from hell\u201d by many other personalities. But Debaters are a genial and enthusiastic personality type for the most part, and pretty much any situation that allows for conversation and a little wordplay is an enjoyable outing. Debaters are actually remarkably good at communicating with friends and acquaintances of other personality types. Their natural tendency to argue as effectively as possible means that Debaters are accustomed to communicating in other people\u2019s language and frame of reference, and this translates well into normal conversation. Where people with the Debater personality type do have difficulty relating to others is in emotional expression, the Achilles\u2019 heel of all Analyst types. Emotions Dismissed Being inclined to suppress their emotions and feelings, when Debaters are faced with a friend who, figuratively or literally, needs a shoulder to cry on, they have no clue how to handle the situation. They are perfectly willing and happy to offer a series of rational, reasonable solutions to the problem at hand, as Debaters do for any situation where a problem needs to be fixed, but they are certainly not known for their sensitivity or outward affection, no matter how intuitively they may understand another\u2019s position. Worse is when Debater personalities try to turn these emotional situations into something they find more comfortable: a debate. Given how remarkably good Debaters are at arguing both sides of a point, they are remarkably bad at putting themselves in someone else\u2019s shoes from an emotional standpoint. Debaters should avoid at all costs the temptation to turn a discussion about the causes of a friend\u2019s recent breakup into competitive intellectual fodder. So long as everyone understands not to take their words too personally, anyone who isn\u2019t afraid to discuss new ideas \u2013 and have them converted into so much confetti \u2013 is likely to find stimulating and thought-provoking friends in Debaters. It\u2019s not a compatibility that clicks with everyone, but Debaters don\u2019t really care about being liked by everyone anyways. As long as they get to alternate between being the sounding board and the megaphone, Debaters and their friends are bound to enjoy each other\u2019s company for a long, long time."}]}

That\u2019s a given for this personality type. Whether Assertive or Turbulent, these qualities are still there. However, they won\u2019t look quite the same under the influence of the Identity personality trait. Our research shows that, despite their considerable commonalities, Assertive Campaigners (ENFP-A) and Turbulent Campaigners (ENFP-T) are not identical. Let\u2019s explore what that typically looks like. Are you a Turbulent Campaigner? Check out \u201cTurbulent Campaigner Superpowers\u201d at the bottom of this article for the deepest insights into who you are. Two Different Ways of Seeing Oneself 74% of Assertive Campaigners consider themselves to be successful, compared to 53% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cSUCCESS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Campaigners are somewhat more likely to see themselves as flourishing in life. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that individual Turbulent Campaigners feel unsuccessful. Our research indicates that Turbulent Campaigners were split nearly fifty-fifty on this topic. But still, comparatively speaking, there is a difference between the two types of Campaigners. It may be important to note that, when compared to the average of all Turbulent individuals from all personality types, Turbulent Campaigners are more likely to say they consider themselves to be successful. This difference may be due in part to Campaigners\u2019 independent spirit. They are more likely to decide that success is whatever they decide success is. Living by their own standards may give them an edge over those who live by the standards of others. 89% of Assertive Campaigners say they have a healthy ego, compared to 61% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cEGO\u201d SURVEY Still, Assertive Campaigners are more likely to see themselves in a positive light, comparatively speaking. But there may be some self-imposed idealistic standard, both demanding and far outside their reach, that the two types of Campaigners respond to differently. Constantly missing goals can take a higher toll on the more sensitive Turbulent Campaigners \u2013 perhaps accounting for the lower percentage of these personalities who say they are successful. While Assertive Campaigners may create similar standards, they are far less likely to look back on misses and feel regret over them. This can somewhat shield their egos. 68% of Assertive Campaigners say they usually brush off a mistake when they make one, compared to 25% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cDOUBTS\u201d SURVEY Individuals with the Campaigner personality type become stressed relatively easily and rarely take anything at face value. They may endow any mistakes they make with much more weight and meaning than such errors deserve. Turbulent Campaigners, compensating for any shortcoming they believe they have, may overthink and overwork solutions to their mistakes in hopes of making up for them. This attention to blunders is perhaps not an entirely bad quality for a personality type that tends to be a little unfocused at times. But such ruminating doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Turbulent Campaigners always follow through. At least, whatever repair work they may need to do is likely to stay on their radar for a longer amount of time. They have more of a feeling of being responsible for focusing on their mistakes longer. Many Assertive Campaigners, on the other hand, may decide to let bygones be bygones and shuck off mistakes easily. This allows them a larger sense of happiness, but they may never resolve certain problems. 69% of Turbulent Campaigners say they are likely to be obsessive about little details when working on something, compared to 44% of Assertive Campaigners. \u201cBEING HANDY\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Campaigners\u2019 need to be more accountable is perhaps reflected in their considerable attention to detail as well. The care they take is probably the product of their Turbulent Identity. These personalities tend to worry about their abilities and may be trying to head off anything that might validate their concerns. Their self-doubt can motivate them to pay much-needed attention to smaller details \u2013 a skill that is not typically thought of as being in the Campaigner toolbox. 72% of Assertive Campaigners consider themselves to be patient people, compared to 41% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cPATIENCE\u201d SURVEY However, while all this rumination and attention to detail is happening with their Turbulent cousins, Assertive Campaigners are likely carrying on without being weighed down by worry or regret. Give confidence to a free spirit, and an even freer spirit may emerge. Instead of looking back, these personalities typically search for new ways to expand the boundaries of their comfort zone. Emotional Inclinations and Interacting with Others 82% of Assertive Campaigners feel like they effectively manage the stress in their lives, compared to 32% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Campaigners are less affected by stressors in their lives because they tend to feel more confident in their ability to handle them. To them, stress is a part of life that they believe they are well able to manage. At times, Assertive Campaigners may underplay the seriousness of something difficult in their lives. But, just as often, being less sensitive to worrisome matters may allow these personalities to act more boldly, relative to their Turbulent counterparts. And, as the saying attributed to Goethe goes, \u201cBoldness has genius, power, and magic in it.\u201d 72% of Assertive Campaigners find it easy to focus on the good things in life when they are feeling down, compared to 41% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST?\u201d SURVEY Assertive Campaigners believe to a more substantial degree than Turbulent Campaigners that they can maintain a positive focus during bad times. Again, these Assertive personalities may want to be cautious when they don their rose-colored glasses to make sure they aren\u2019t missing crucial matters. Turbulent Campaigners are less likely to chase good thoughts as a way of dealing with negative feelings. It\u2019s important to bounce back quickly, but maybe focusing on the bad times long enough to glean their lessons has its value too. 77% of Assertive Campaigners feel like they have control over their emotions, compared to 39% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Campaigners as a group are less likely than Assertive Campaigners to lay claim to control over their emotions. Most Assertive Campaigners say they have control over their emotions. There is no better or worse here. Too much control over emotions can be as damaging as too little control. If there is too much control, Assertive Campaigners can come across as colder and more aloof than Turbulent Campaigners might. Such detachment can leave them appearing a bit arrogant. Again, it\u2019s all relative. Neither personality variant lacks warmth. But Turbulent Campaigners may be able to show their humanity to others a little more quickly and a little more deeply than their Assertive counterparts. 81% of Assertive Campaigners say their pride is a product of understanding themselves rather than praise from other people, compared to 58% of Turbulent Campaigners. \u201cPRIDE\u201d SURVEY Turbulent Campaigners are more likely than Assertive Campaigners to say their pride comes from what others think of them. This may also lend itself to their accessibility. A hallmark of the Campaigner personality type is the desire to connect with others. Other people will also matter to Assertive Campaigners \u2013 just in different amounts and perhaps in different ways. Summary Assertive Campaigners are much more likely to say they see themselves in a positive light than Turbulent Campaigners. Turbulent Campaigners tend to hang on to their mistakes longer than their Assertive counterparts. Should they not find it too painful, this clinging to missteps may allow them to see and deal with problems that Assertive Campaigners might overlook. More Assertive Campaigners say they deal effectively with stressors and have control over their emotions. This difference can represent both an advantage and disadvantage in life for either Campaigner personality type. Research suggests different levels of concern over the opinions of others. Turbulent Campaigners are likely to look for the approval of others, while Assertive Campaigners prefer independence from the appraisal of others. It\u2019s All a Matter of Degrees Sometimes it takes splitting hairs to discuss the Identity differences of this personality type. For example, a majority of both Turbulent and Assertive Campaigners see themselves as successful. Even though Assertive Campaigners are more likely to tout their success, it would be inaccurate to say Turbulent Campaigners don\u2019t see themselves that way \u2013 more than half do. However, pronounced Identity differences still exist in areas such as emotions, the opinions of others, and handling mistakes, to name a few. Knowing these tendencies, no matter how subtle, may help both Assertive and Turbulent Campaigners navigate the world a little better."}]}

Because they value honesty and straightforwardness so highly, people with the Executive personality type are likely to be clear about who they are, what they\u2019re like and what their goals are from the start, and to stick to those statements long-term. So long as their partner is able to take them at their word and follow suit, they are bound to be extremely stable relationships. A Steadfast Love This isn\u2019t to say that there isn\u2019t any growth of course \u2013 character development is always a high priority for Executives, and each life goal is important. Rather, it\u2019s that shifting moods, goals and desires are unlikely to fundamentally alter the basis of Executives\u2019 relationships. There are certainly challenges, but Executives take their relationships seriously and are willing to put a tremendous amount of effort into ensuring that they remain strong and committed, and that effort pays off. This may all sound a little stale, and indeed Executives are not spontaneous or unpredictable people, but they do very much enjoy taking their partners out and having fun. Social events and activities are Executives\u2019 idea of a good time, and while they may rely on familiar people and places, they do bring lots of energy and enthusiasm, which helps keep things interesting. Executives approach intimacy with similarly physical, active intentions, and from fairly traditional ones as well. Wild ideas and poetry are for less mature personalities, or so Executives might say, though they do appreciate recognition and well-placed compliments to maintain high self-esteem. They may look for more stability in their sex lives than most, but Executives never fail to bring their characteristic vigor. This hints at a challenge in Executives\u2019 relationships though, and that is emotional intimacy. Touchy-feely moments are few, as are verbal statements of love; this is usually fine, as Executive personalities find other, more tangible ways to express their affection. The problem is in recognizing the validity of those qualities in others, rather than simply dismissing them as pointless or irrational, something that can be extremely hurtful if Executives\u2019 partners are more sensitive. The Limits of Rationality Executives address conflict head-on with simple statements of fact \u2013 a very rational approach \u2013 but subtlety and emotional tact are sacrificed in the process. While Executives\u2019 level-headed, calm approach is appreciated by many, for others it is an uncomfortably direct approach. For all their social skills, Executives are especially bad at reading the emotional side of other people, and when it comes to their partners, it\u2019s more important than ever to try to improve. Executives are people of strong principles and strong self-confidence. They use these qualities to protect their partners with admirable consistency. But people with the Executive personality type are also stubborn, with a firm belief in their rightness, and they can quickly damage more sensitive partners\u2019 fragile feelings. With this in mind, it is often best for Executives to find fellow Observant (S) partners in order to minimize communication barriers, with one or two opposing traits to balance their forceful character and provide opportunities for growth."}]}

But while people with this personality type value and even cherish their friendships, they don\u2019t find it easy to bond with just anyone. Defenders tend to be private and a bit protective of themselves, and it can take them a while to feel comfortable enough to open up to someone new. This explains why most of Defenders\u2019 friendships don\u2019t start as random encounters on a wild night out, but rather through comfortable and consistent contact \u2013 for example, at school or at work. Defenders appreciate the opportunity to deepen their connection with another person over time, with the two friends gradually sharing more and more of themselves with each other. Getting Along Deep down, many Defenders long to be liked and accepted. This is a natural desire, and it helps explain why people with this personality type are known for being such thoughtful, reliable friends. Defenders care about what other people think of them, so they strive to bring their best selves to all of their relationships, including their friendships. Defenders know that being a good friend takes effort \u2013 and they\u2019re more than willing to put in the work. This trait tends to make Defenders exceptional friends. If taken too far, however, it can lead them to fall into the trap of people-pleasing. Some personality types have no trouble expressing an unpopular opinion or posing an awkward question \u2013 but not Defenders. Defenders are reluctant to rock the boat, whether that means asking a friend to pay back a loan or disagreeing with where everyone else wants to go for dinner. In most cases, this behavior stems from a fear of being rejected. While most Defenders are perfectly comfortable having a small, tight-knit circle of friends, they hate the idea of risking the disapproval of even one of those friends. The problem is that, over time, people-pleasing can cause Defenders to lose touch with their sense of self and their ability to make decisions on their own terms. Seeking Balance Few personality types can match Defenders\u2019 fervent desire to be there for their friends through thick and thin. Ever ready to offer advice, help, and reassurance, Defenders take pride in the fact that people turn to them in times of need \u2013 in fact, showing up for their friends in this way offers people with this personality type a sense of purpose in life. Defenders appreciate their friends deeply, and they aren\u2019t afraid to show it \u2013 but it may be difficult for them to ask for that same appreciation in return. In return, all Defenders wish for is loyalty and respect \u2013 and, in an ideal world, a bit of recognition for all that they do. But even though many Defenders crave validation and support from their friends, they tend to be too proud to ask for it, just as they may not be comfortable asking for the help that they need. Fortunately, with time, many Defenders learn that anyone who takes advantage of their generous, altruistic nature isn\u2019t a true friend. An Inspired Bond Defenders can become attached to their visions of how things \u201cshould\u201d be. In the world of friendship, they may believe \u2013 consciously or not \u2013 that they should be completely selfless. But when they ease up on this expectation, balancing their friends\u2019 needs with their own, people with this personality type can bring the full magnitude of their gifts to their friendships. And this helps them enjoy the sort of meaningful, enduring bonds that make life all the more worthwhile."}]}

In a purely rational world, this approach would be foolproof. Alas, love is rarely rational, and Architects are at risk of overlooking or misinterpreting the unpredictability of human nature and affection. For people with this personality type, finding a compatible partner can be a particular challenge. Rarely satisfied with things as they are, Architects can\u2019t help but imagine how the world could be better than it already is \u2013 and they often bring this same mindset to the realm of love. Unfortunately, if Architects apply a relentlessly critical eye to every potential partner, they may find themselves constantly dissatisfied. The Woes of Dating Architects value depth, intelligence, and unmitigated honesty. For them, a relationship that isn\u2019t founded on these values simply isn\u2019t worth pursuing. It might not come as a surprise, then, that the unspoken rules and social niceties of the dating world can seem useless or even insulting to these personalities. The good news is that Architects\u2019 honesty and refusal to play games can be a breath of fresh air when it comes to dating. The bad news? Many romantic conventions exist for a reason \u2013 often because they make people feel comfortable or special or intrigued. And when Architects refuse to play along, they may find dating difficult, if not impossible. As Architects often learn, the ways of love are hard to describe in a spreadsheet. As they mature and gain experience, many Architects eventually come to understand the purpose of romantic rituals. Until that point, however, they may decide that dating is too irrational or beneath them. Some people with this personality type might claim to be above the \u201csilliness\u201d of dating in an effort to demonstrate their intellectual superiority. Obviously, this mindset is unlikely to help Architects find or connect with a partner. Sometimes Architects\u2019 best strategy is to focus on what they enjoy rather than struggle against the rules of dating. Ironically, people with this personality type are often most attractive when they aren\u2019t caught up in trying to be. Just doing what they do best \u2013 pursuing the interests that light them up \u2013 can help their confidence and intelligence shine. Emotion Sickness This personality type isn\u2019t known for conventional shows of romance, such as sending flowers or writing mushy notes. Most Architects spend more time thinking about love than expressing it. But when they believe that a relationship has potential, Architects are more than capable of giving it their all, even if that takes them out of their comfort zone. And a healthy, long-term relationship is pretty much guaranteed to take Architects out of their comfort zone at some point. In particular, emotions can feel like a second language to these personalities. When their partner shares strong feelings, Architects\u2019 default is often to shut down or to analyze the situation, rather than simply listening and offering support. And when it\u2019s time for Architects to share the inner workings of their own hearts, they may feel uncomfortable and exposed. For Architects, becoming comfortable with their partner\u2019s emotions \u2013 and their own \u2013 can take more than a little practice. Architects aren\u2019t always ready to share their feelings, but it would be a mistake to think that they don\u2019t have feelings \u2013 or that those feelings don\u2019t run deep. Love is rarely easy, but it\u2019s a challenge that can help Architect personalities grow. Through their relationships, they can learn to focus on the present, get in touch with their emotions, remain involved with other people, and stay open to things that they\u2019re not used to. For a personality type so intent on self-development, these opportunities can make love even more satisfying."}]}

Often representing the epitome of family values, people with the Logistician personality type are comfortable with, and often even encourage traditional household and gender roles, and look to a family structure guided by clear expectations and honesty. While their reserved nature often makes dating Logisticians challenging, they are truly dedicated partners, willing to devote tremendous thought and energy to ensure stable and mutually satisfying relationships. Deeply Committed Blind dates and random hookups are not Logisticians\u2019 preferred methods for finding potential partners. The risk and unpredictability of these situations has Logisticians\u2019 alarm bells ringing, and being dragged out for a night of dancing at the club just isn\u2019t going to happen. Logistician personalities much prefer more responsible, conservative methods of dating, such as dinner with an interested coworker or, in their more adventurous moods, a setup organized through a mutual friend. Logisticians approach relationships, as with most things, from a rational perspective, looking for compatibility and the mutual satisfaction of daily and long-term needs. This isn\u2019t a process that Logisticians take lightly, and once commitments are established, they stick to their promises to the very end. Logisticians establish foundations, fulfill their responsibilities, and keep their relationships functional and stable. As their relationships transitions into the long-term, Logisticians gladly see to the necessary daily tasks around the house, applying the same sense of duty to their home life that they do in the workplace. While this may not translate into particularly exotic intimate lives, Logisticians are dependable lovers who want very much for their partners to remain satisfied. It takes patience on the part of more adventurous partners, but if different activities can be demonstrated as equally or more enjoyable than those already within Logisticians\u2019 comfort zones, they are perfectly capable of trying something new. However, emotional satisfaction can be another matter. While Logisticians are able to provide surprisingly good emotional support, this only happens when they realize that it\u2019s necessary, and there\u2019s the rub. Logisticians are not naturally receptive to others\u2019 emotions, not unless they are stated clearly, and a partner usually only says \u201cI\u2019m angry\u201d when it\u2019s too late to address the initial grievance. A Reliable Heart People with the Logistician personality type can get so caught up in the belief in their correctness, in \u201cwinning\u201d arguments they thought were about facts, that they don\u2019t realize their partner may have viewed things from a perspective of consideration and sensitivity. Especially with more sensitive partners, this can be a huge challenge for the relationship. Ultimately though, Logisticians\u2019 senses of responsibility and dedication set the tone, and they spare no effort in noting to this distinction moving forward, the consequences having been demonstrated as real. While Logisticians\u2019 staid approach may seem boring to some, there is an undeniable attractiveness to it, though felt perhaps more by respect and admiration than emotional passion. Logisticians\u2019 shells hide a strong and quiet determination and reliability, rare among other personality types, which can benefit even the flightiest personalities, allowing them to stay connected to the real world while still exploring new territory. Partners who share the Observant (S) trait are the best fit for Logistician personalities, with one or two opposing traits to create balance and to expand Logisticians\u2019 sometimes overly isolated world, such as partners with Extraverted (E) or Prospecting (P) traits."}]}

Friendships with the Executive personality type are often defined by their mutual activities and routines, by external factors, more so than the sense of intellectual or mystical compatibility that many Analyst and Diplomat personalities share among themselves. But this in no way diminishes the relationships \u2013 Executives\u2019 friendships of dependability and mutual interest can be powerful connections that endure life\u2019s changes with immutable constancy. Setting the Course Among their established friends, Executives show themselves to be outgoing and enthusiastic, always more than happy to bring others along for some healthy sport and outdoor activity. Executives sometimes get a little overbearing in their push for participation, but it\u2019s just because they want everyone to have a good time. Executives\u2019 friends are never short on invites to social activities and events, from tickets to a local ball game, to a weekend camping trip, to Sunday BBQ. Executives seek strong friendships founded on trust and loyalty (though loyalty to family does come first). Active and with quick minds, people with the Executive personality type can\u2019t ever be accused of not doing enough to fend off a little boredom. While Executives may not always be the life of the party, they know how to play their part in making sure their friends have a good time. The way Executives establish and maintain their friendships does limit the pool though, as they tend to seek out people who are similar to themselves, who share their respect for traditions and institutions. Executive personalities are naturally stubborn, and it can be hard for them to find enough common ground with people who constantly disagree with their principles and beliefs to really form those ties of friendship. A Broader Reach Executives\u2019 challenge in friendship isn\u2019t about finding fun things to do or people to do them with, but in finding diversity in their friends and activities. For all their community participation, Executives struggle immensely in even fully listening to differing opinions, let alone befriending people who consistently express alternate viewpoints. Whether about local political issues or the validity of a more emotional, idealistic disposition than they think is reasonable, Executives should make an effort to truly understand these alternate viewpoints. Simply put, it\u2019s healthy for Executives to have some loyal opposition. Exposing themselves to new ideas among acquaintances who think differently can do no harm \u2013 either people with the Executive personality type discover better ways and a stronger foundation, or they gain all the more confidence in their beliefs for having successfully defended them. Just as Executives may think those loners who spend their lives in their basements playing video games need to get out more, Executives themselves need to make sure they get out of their own bubbles of unchallenged opinions and beliefs."}]}

This by no means suggests that people with the Commander personality type are bad parents \u2013 far from it \u2013 simply that their relationships with children, who are typically more sensitive and less able to conduct truly rational analysis, require a great deal more emotional tact and personal liberty than they are accustomed to giving. But Commanders are always up for a challenge, and will take their roles as parents seriously and with the utmost sense of personal responsibility. Holding themselves to a higher standard than most, Commander personalities see the success of their children as a reflection of those personal standards, and want nothing more than to see them grow into smart, independent people who strive to achieve their goals. Establishing specific moral values is less important to Commanders than the cultivation of the intellect and independent, rational thought. Building Emotional Tolerance Commanders welcome differences of opinion, and this is true with their children as well. But while gladly having rational, well-thought-out discussions about roles and responsibilities, at the end of the day Commanders expect their authority to be respected. A disagreement is no excuse for shirking established responsibilities, and Commander parents can be utterly uncompromising in maintaining this structure. This strictness can be a tremendous source of tension in the household \u2013 a little flexibility can go a long way. When these debates devolve into emotional appeals is when Commander parents run into real trouble, as their persistent weakness with emotional tolerance makes dealing with growing children, especially adolescents, their most significant challenge. As in their other relationships, Commander parents should strive to strengthen this skill \u2013 often enough young children don\u2019t have the words to express their needs rationally, and adolescents don\u2019t have the patience for it, a perfectly natural condition. By learning to listen to emotional expression as a valid form of communication and responding in kind, Commanders can help to minimize emotional conflicts with their children, building trust that will help to smooth the otherwise rebellious teenage years. Fostering Independence Commander parents should remember that a part of developing that necessary sense of independence is being able to control one\u2019s own schedule and activities, to chart one\u2019s own course, at least to a certain extent. People with the Commander personality type will spare no effort for their children, but it\u2019s sometimes the case that taking a deep breath and loosening their structures as their children grow and mature does more to achieve their goal of raising capable, intelligent adults than forced extracurriculars ever could."}]}

And if it doesn\u2019t involve too many draining social interactions or phone calls, so much the better. Ever the idealists, Mediators might struggle to find a profession that meets their practical needs and fulfills their dreams. These personalities may drift in frustration, waiting for the perfect job to present itself and eventually feeling stuck or worried that they\u2019re not living up to their potential. Alas, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfect job, and the question of whether to settle for a less-than-ideal position can weigh heavily on people with this personality type. Fortunately, Mediators\u2019 creativity, independence, and sincere desire to connect with and help others can help them shine \u2013 and find fulfillment \u2013 in nearly any line of work. A Place for Everyone Certain careers and vocations seem to hold a special allure for these personalities. With their curiosity and their love of self-expression, many Mediators dream of becoming writers. They might write novels, seek out interesting freelance niches, or even find themselves doing communications in a corporate field or for a nonprofit organization. Richly imaginative, Mediators can infuse even the driest of fundraising or marketing materials with new life. Sensitive to artistic beauty, some Mediators simply come to life in the worlds of writing, music, drama, or dance. Although this personality type isn\u2019t known for seeking the spotlight, other Mediators find their life purpose in the performing arts. These Mediators can draw from their inner depths to pull out exquisite interpretations of a creator\u2019s work. They may also create their own works as playwrights, composers, or choreographers. Whatever they do, Mediators want to feel that their work is helping others. It\u2019s not surprising, then, that many people with this personality type choose careers that are focused on service, such as counseling, psychology, teaching, health care, social work, massage therapy, or physical rehabilitation. For these caring, supportive personalities, few things are more meaningful than seeing their work help change someone\u2019s life for the better. Finding Their Way Mediators are adaptable, but they may find it demotivating to work in high-stress, bureaucratic, or hectic environments. They can also become frustrated by workplaces that are highly critical or competitive. Workplaces that reward independence tend to be a good fit for Mediators, although they may appreciate some structure and oversight to help them avoid procrastinating and getting lost in thought. That said, Mediators don\u2019t need ideal conditions to thrive professionally. These personalities want to live in tune with their values, in their careers as much as in any other aspect of their lives.

For Advocate personalities, success doesn\u2019t come from money or status but from seeking fulfillment, helping others, and being a force for good in the world. While they have lofty goals and ambitions, Advocates shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for idle dreamers. People with this personality type care about integrity, and they\u2019re rarely satisfied until they\u2019ve done what they know to be right. Conscientious to the core, they move through life with a clear sense of their values, and they aim never to lose sight of what truly matters \u2013 not according to other people or society at large, but according to their own wisdom and intuition. Seeking Purpose Perhaps because their personality type is so uncommon, Advocates tend to carry around a sense \u2013 whether conscious or not \u2013 of being different from most people. With their rich inner lives and their deep, abiding desire to find their life purpose, they don\u2019t always fit in with those around them. This isn\u2019t to say that Advocates can\u2019t enjoy social acceptance or close relationships \u2013 only that they sometimes feel misunderstood or at odds with the world. Fortunately, this sense of being out of step doesn\u2019t diminish Advocates\u2019 commitment to making the world a better place. Advocates are troubled by injustice, and they typically care more about altruism than personal gain. They often feel called to use their strengths \u2013 including creativity, imagination, and sensitivity \u2013 to uplift others and spread compassion. Nothing lights up Advocates like changing someone else\u2019s life for the better. Many Advocates see helping others as their mission in life, and they\u2019re always looking for ways to step in and speak up for what is right. People with this personality type also aspire to fix society\u2019s deeper problems, in the hope that unfairness and hardship can become things of the past. At times, however, Advocates may focus so intently on their ideals that they don\u2019t take adequate care of themselves \u2013 a pattern that can lead to stress and burnout. Connecting with Others (and Themselves) Advocates may be Introverted, but they value deep, authentic relationships with others. Few things bring these personalities as much joy as truly knowing another person \u2013 and being known in return. Advocates enjoy meaningful conversations far more than small talk, and they tend to communicate in a way that is warm and sensitive. This emotional honesty and insight can make a powerful impression on the people around them. A few close relationships, provided that they\u2019re genuine, can fill Advocates\u2019 hearts to the brim. Thoughtful and compassionate, Advocates pour a great deal of energy and care into their relationships. This doesn\u2019t mean that they always feel appreciated in return. Advocates tend to act with great thought and care, and it can frustrate them when other people don\u2019t recognize their good intentions. As a result, even constructive criticism may feel incredibly personal or hurtful to these personalities. A Personal Mission Many Advocates feel that their life has a unique purpose \u2013 a mission that they were put onto this earth to fulfill. For people with this personality type, one of the most rewarding aspects of life is seeking out this purpose \u2013 and then, once they\u2019ve found it, striving to do it justice. When Advocates encounter inequity or unfairness, they rarely give up \u2013 instead, they consult their intuition and their compassion to find a solution. With their innate ability to balance the heart with the head, Advocates are hardwired to right the wrongs of the world, no matter how big or small. These personalities just need to remember that while they\u2019re busy taking care of everyone else, they need to pause sometimes and take care of themselves as well."}]}

And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it\u2019s almost certainly Architects. In theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, Architects are exactly that. But people with this personality type may be harsh or dismissive toward coworkers they don\u2019t respect \u2013 and unfortunately, losing Architects\u2019 respect can be all too easy. In particular, Architects may struggle to work with colleagues who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success. Architect Subordinates Architects are known for their independence. Their worst nightmare would be a micromanaging boss who monopolizes their time with pointless meetings, insists on useless rules, or appraises employees\u2019 performance based on how likable they seem rather than their actual merits. Even in entry-level jobs, Architect personalities may chafe at anyone who tries to limit their freedom. Titles mean little to Architects, and they often struggle to defer to a manager they consider less intelligent than themselves. They might also find it difficult to restrain themselves from offering their bosses feedback and criticism \u2013 an approach that, depending on the boss, can backfire. In the real world, not all bosses will be as logical or open-minded as Architects might prefer. But that doesn\u2019t mean that people with this personality type should allow a less-than-ideal manager to hold them back. Architects can use their creativity and ingenuity to expand their responsibilities and develop their expertise \u2013 even if they don\u2019t have the independence that they crave. To do this, they may need to prioritize building a productive and respectful relationship with their manager, no matter how far from perfect that person may be. Architect Colleagues Few Architects choose jobs that require constant teamwork or social interaction. To these personalities, most team-building techniques and group meetings are a waste of time. And chitchat, gossip, and office politics \u2013 well, those can be nothing short of workplace plagues. Even a brainstorming session, normally a delight for Architects, can become tedious if it just goes in circles without leading to clear action. Most Architects would rather work alone than be slowed down by a pleasant but unfocused coworker. Fortunately, their determination and focus often enable Architects to produce effective results, even without the help of others. That\u2019s not to say that Architects can\u2019t work with others \u2013 in fact, they may achieve some of their greatest successes this way. Relentlessly curious and capable, they can make for excellent collaborators. People with this personality type may never enjoy pairing up with just anyone, but if they look more closely, they often find that at least some of their coworkers deserve their respect. And in the company of trusted colleagues, Architects\u2019 brainstorming sessions may become even more electric. Architect Managers Though they may be surprised to hear it, Architect personalities can make great leaders. In the workplace, they rarely throw around their authority just to prove that they\u2019re in charge. Instead, they look for ways to promote innovation and effectiveness \u2013 even if that means breaking with established hierarchies. Some managers might enjoy being pandered to, but Architects would rather be successful than constantly validated. Generally speaking, Architects prefer to treat those who work for them as equals. Rather than micromanaging, these personalities aim to direct broader strategies while letting other people handle day-to-day activities. That\u2019s not to say that they\u2019re completely hands-off, however. Architect bosses want to know exactly what\u2019s going on and when, and they're always ready to drill into any level of detail necessary to find out. These managers respect and reward proactive behavior, delegating responsibilities to employees with the strongest critical-thinking skills. But this independence isn\u2019t just granted \u2013 it\u2019s required. Employees who struggle to direct themselves \u2013 who just want to be told what to do \u2013 may have a hard time meeting Architects\u2019 standards. And anyone who tries to cover up bad results with flattery or excuses is likely to be disappointed, as those strategies almost never fool Architects."}]}

Whether subordinates, among colleagues or as managers, people with the Executive personality type create order, follow the rules, and work to ensure that their work and the work of those around them is completed to the highest standards. Cutting corners and shirking responsibility are the quickest ways to lose Executives\u2019 respect. Executive Subordinates Executives are hard-working and do things by the book. Though sometimes stubborn and inflexible, especially when presented with ideas that haven\u2019t been fully developed, Executive personalities are open to new methods that can be demonstrated to be better. However, Executives are unlikely to do much experimenting on their own \u2013 adhering to stated responsibilities and fulfilling their duties is their primary concern. Executives are also well-known for their loyalty and dedication, but in some ways this is contingent on their respect. People with this personality type are willing to voice their opinions, especially in deciding what is and is not acceptable \u2013 if provided with sensible responses that address their concerns, they are often satisfied with that. If Executives view their managers as illogical, dishonest or cowardly in their methods, they can be uncomfortably honest, if still calm and level, in voicing their opinions on that as well. Executive Colleagues Executives enjoy the hustle and bustle of well-organized workplaces. Honest, friendly and down-to-earth, Executive personalities are great networkers who enjoy connecting with others to get things done. Abusing this for advancement is unlikely, and is in fact something Executives frown upon. Shortcuts are irresponsible, and people with the Executive personality type lose respect quickly for those who try to push forward by showing off or promoting bold but risky ideas, making relationships with more inspiration-oriented colleagues a challenge. Executives like to feel like they are a part of the team, and a part of the greater organization that they work for. To make sure this happens, Executives are nearly always willing to accept criticism that can help to improve their effectiveness, and always keep an eye on their surroundings to make sure they and their team deliver the results that are expected of them. Executive Managers Executives take genuine pleasure in organizing others into effective teams, and as managers they have no better opportunity to do so. While sometimes overbearing, even micromanaging, Executives\u2019 strong wills also serve to defend their teams and principles against diversions and cutbacks, regardless of who brings them. Laziness and bad work ethic are not tolerated by Executives under any circumstances. Executives project natural authority, but they sometimes expect this authority to be abided unconditionally, resisting change and demanding that things be done by the book. Whether Executives\u2019 own book or the existing rules and traditions are used is subject to circumstances, but they do tend to rest on the security of tradition and precedent. Regardless, Executives\u2019 expectations are clearly expressed, leaving little room or tolerance for deviation from the agenda."}]}

Wherever they find themselves on the job ladder, they try to cultivate an emotional and moral connection to what they do \u2013 looking for reassurance that their day-to-day efforts are helping other people in some shape or form. This desire to be of service colors how Mediator personalities respond to authority in the workplace as well as how they express it. Mediator Subordinates As employees, Mediators tend to be loyal, upbeat, and considerate. They take pride in being honest and doing the right thing in all circumstances. People with this personality type also feel gratified by pleasing others, from their bosses to their customers. Mediators feel most motivated when they\u2019re thinking up ways to help others, not worrying about checklists or bottom lines. This explains why praise and positive feedback can make them light up. On the flip side, criticism can lead these personalities to shut down. When faced with punishing expectations or a highly negative boss, they may find it hard to get things done. Add the distraction of a constantly ringing phone or an overflowing inbox, and you have a recipe for a seriously stressed out Mediator. Mediator employees enjoy having freedom and latitude. Their creativity and insight enable them to shake up old, ineffective ways of doing things \u2013 as long as they\u2019re given the chance to speak up and make changes. That said, they tend to benefit from deadlines and clear expectations to keep them on track. Otherwise, people with this personality type might get caught up in procrastination, bouncing from one idea to another rather than settling down and crossing tasks off their to-do list. Mediator Colleagues Mediators value equality and fairness, so it\u2019s no surprise that they can feel stifled by workplace hierarchies. They prefer professional environments where everyone feels valued and is encouraged to share their ideas \u2013 no matter their job title. As colleagues, Mediators do what they can to make this ideal a reality. In their quiet way, Mediators can become the glue that holds their workplace together. Although their voice might not be the loudest, they are often admired for their insight, with coworkers routinely coming to them for advice. Pleasant and kindhearted, Mediators don\u2019t like conflict, drama, or workplace politics. Instead, they try to act in ways that foster harmony and cooperation. When someone needs help, Mediators tend to pitch in without any expectation of praise or recognition. One of Mediators\u2019 greatest contributions as colleagues is their empathetic communication style. These personalities speak in a way that\u2019s honest but kind, which can set a positive tone for the entire workplace. Mediator Managers As managers, Mediators are among the personality types least likely to act as if they\u2019re in charge. They respect their employees as full-fledged human beings, not just as workers. Rather than make all the decisions themselves, Mediators often ask to hear their employees\u2019 thoughts and opinions. In general, people with this personality type don\u2019t micromanage. Instead, they keep their eyes on the big picture. They see it as their responsibility to support their employees, not to tell them exactly what to do and how to do it. Whenever possible, they encourage the people who work for them to develop their own ideas and use their own best judgment. There is a downside to this management style. Sometimes Mediators may struggle to set boundaries, drill down on inefficiencies, or offer criticism, even when it\u2019s necessary. This can slow down their team and create needless stress, both for Mediators and for their employees. At times, managers with this personality type may need to be strict for the good of their team \u2013 and the workplace as a whole."}]}

People with this personality type can always be relied on for their kindness and ability to listen carefully to concerns \u2013 and to find ways to resolve them. Win-win situations are Defenders\u2019 bread and butter, and no other personality type can quite match the satisfaction that they take in finding practical, clear resolutions to day-to-day challenges. Defender Subordinates As employees, Defenders exemplify the strength of humble dedication. Relied on and respected for their patience and commitment, people with this personality type really only need one reward for their work: the satisfaction of knowing that they\u2019ve helped someone. And if that person expresses a bit of gratitude, so much the better. At times, Defenders\u2019 radical humility can hold them back. They tend to be unwilling to play up their achievements, often for fear of creating unnecessary friction. Unfortunately, this can make it all too easy for their bosses to overlook them when opportunities for promotion come along. Defenders\u2019 humility is a strength \u2013 but people with this personality type may struggle to get new opportunities unless they learn to take at least some credit for all the work that they do. Defenders\u2019 loyalty and dependability often makes them invaluable to their bosses. In general, people with this personality type can be trusted to carry out their tasks precisely and without complaint. But Defenders\u2019 aversion to rocking the boat may make it difficult for them to correct or disagree with their bosses or coworkers, even when it\u2019s necessary to do so in order to avoid wasted time and energy. Fortunately, with time, many Defenders learn to express their opinions (and corrections) in a gentle, nonjudgmental way. Defender Colleagues For Defenders, an ideal work environment is founded on working together with colleagues rather than competing against them, with everyone collaborating toward the shared goal of getting the job done. Close-knit and supportive teams are what Defender personalities enjoy most, allowing them to express their altruistic spirit among people who rely on their dedication and warmth. Defenders build relationships with their colleagues naturally \u2013 a skill that they use to keep things running smoothly, not to ingratiate themselves with others. These strengths can become drawbacks, however, as Defenders\u2019 aversion to conflict and their desire to help can be abused by less scrupulous colleagues. Instead of only asking for help when they need it, some colleagues may heap extra work on Defenders\u2019 desks, knowing that Defender colleagues have a hard time saying no. Unless they learn to set boundaries, Defenders can feel overburdened and stressed \u2013 and not a little taken advantage of. Defender Managers Defenders don\u2019t always raise their hands for leadership opportunities, but their interpersonal skills and work ethic can lend themselves quite well to managing others. As managers, Defenders tend to be warm and approachable, always willing to answer questions and always ready to step up and help. Having no real desire to exercise power over others, Defender personalities prefer to work alongside their subordinates, keeping things running smoothly and minimizing conflict. Defenders bring a team spirit to their work, and they aim to impart this spirit to the people they manage. Defender managers care about efficiency and effectiveness, but never at the expense of maintaining a positive relationship with their subordinates. Change can be a challenge for bosses with this personality type \u2013 including the none-too-pleasant change of firing someone who isn\u2019t working out. At times, Defender managers may sink a bit too much of their energy into an underperforming employee \u2013 but they\u2019d much rather make this mistake than the mistake of giving up on someone who just needed another chance."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "INTP's parenthood"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Parenthood In parenting, as with many social roles, Logicians face a robust but healthy challenge. At times, they may be baffled by their children\u2019s messy, irrational, and ever-changing \u2013 but completely natural \u2013 emotions. After all, children have yet to develop the sort of agency and logic that Logicians take for granted. Still, parenthood can be extremely meaningful for Logicians. With their curiosity and love of learning, parents with this personality type can find great joy in teaching their children about the world. Tolerant and open-minded, Logicians encourage their children to think independently, seek out new knowledge, and voice and defend their own opinions. To Thine Own Self Be True Parents with this personality type don\u2019t fret about social expectations. In other words, they rarely obsess over parenting advice or other people\u2019s ideas of how their children should behave. They\u2019re also unlikely to push their children toward a traditional life of school > career > marriage > house > kids > retirement (and in that order, thank you very much). Logicians have little interest in exerting control over others. They allow their children to form their own principles and opinions \u2013 though they may also share their own perspectives and ideas, just in case. This isn\u2019t to say that Logicians don\u2019t have expectations of their children \u2013 they do. They expect their children to be self-motivated and independent. They hope that, when their children are old enough, they\u2019ll have the critical-thinking abilities necessary to decide on their own life path and figure out how to go after it. The Gift of Freedom Logicians encourage their children\u2019s curiosity, giving them the freedom to acquire knowledge and expand their horizons. These parents generally take a relaxed, intellectual approach toward their children. Rather than imposing needless rules or strict schedules, they aim to create a home environment that encourages exploration and independence. For Logician personalities, honoring their children\u2019s independence is a sign of respect. But for many children (and even young adults), this level of personal freedom can be daunting. If their home life doesn\u2019t include reasonable boundaries and parental guidance, these children may find themselves unfocused or adrift, convinced that they need to figure out the world on their own \u2013 a tall order indeed. Paradoxically, a stable home base of caring rules and parental validation can be exactly what Logicians\u2019 children need in order to blossom into their unique, independent selves. Fortunately, Logicians have the mental flexibility to understand that they can encourage their children\u2019s independence without being too hands-off. Parents with this personality type can reestablish balance by making sure that they\u2019re available to offer advice and support whenever their children need it. They can also set clear, common-sense boundaries and establish reasonable consequences for misbehavior, so that their children can navigate daily life without relying entirely on their own burgeoning self-control. A Worthy Challenge Offering emotional support may not be easy for Logician parents \u2013 in fact, along with establishing rules and boundaries, it may be among their greatest challenges. The good news is that these personalities are more than capable of meeting this challenge, although it can take some effort. Logicians want to empower their children to solve their own problems and meet their own needs. This is a worthy goal, but children need a steady foundation of validation and support \u2013 along with the aforementioned rules and boundaries \u2013 before they can tackle the world on their own. To help create this foundation, Logician parents need to express the love, affection, and admiration that they feel for their children. Outpourings of affection may seem awkward or over-the-top to rational-minded Logicians, but these words and actions go a long way toward helping children feel loved, accepted, and secure. Logicians want nothing more than for their children to grow up smart and independent. As long as parents with this personality type teach empathy alongside rationality, their children can grow into confident adults who know how to ask questions, use their minds, and take care of themselves no matter what comes their way."}]}

The World Is Your Oyster Early in life, this attitude is tremendously beneficial for Virtuosos\u2019 children. At this age, every little thing is a miracle, to be explored with every sense. Blocks don\u2019t just have distinct colors and shapes, but smells and tastes too, and this sort of sensory exploration is right up Virtuosos\u2019 alley.

People with the Commander personality type will root out such behavior wherever they go. Energetic \u2013 Rather than finding this process taxing Commanders are energized by it, genuinely enjoying leading their teams forward as they implement their plans and goals. Self-Confident \u2013 Commanders couldn\u2019t do this if they were plagued by self-doubt \u2013 they trust their abilities, make known their opinions, and believe in their capacities as leaders. Strong-Willed \u2013 Nor do they give up when the going gets tough \u2013 Commander personalities strive to achieve their goals, but really nothing is quite as satisfying to them as rising to the challenge of each obstacle in their run to the finish line. Strategic Thinkers \u2013 Commanders exemplify the difference between moment-to-moment crisis management and navigating the challenges and steps of a bigger plan, and are known for examining every angle of a problem and not just resolving momentary issues, but moving the whole project forward with their solutions. Charismatic and Inspiring \u2013 These qualities combine to create individuals who are able to inspire and invigorate others, who people actually want to be their leaders, and this in turn helps Commanders to accomplish their often ambitious goals that could never be finished alone. Commander Weaknesses Stubborn and Dominant \u2013 Sometimes all this confidence and willpower can go too far, and Commanders are all too capable of digging in their heels, trying to win every single debate and pushing their vision, and theirs alone. Intolerant \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway\u201d \u2013 People with the Commander personality type are notoriously unsupportive of any idea that distracts from their primary goals, and even more so of ideas based on emotional considerations. Commanders won\u2019t hesitate a second to make that fact clear to those around them. Impatient \u2013 Some people need more time to think than others, an intolerable delay to quick-thinking Commanders. They may misinterpret contemplation as stupidity or disinterest in their haste, a terrible mistake for a leader to make. Arrogant \u2013 Commander personalities respect quick thoughts and firm convictions, their own qualities, and look down on those who don\u2019t match up. This relationship is a challenge for most other personality types who are perhaps not timid in their own right, but will seem so beside overbearing Commanders. Poor Handling of Emotions \u2013 All this bluster, alongside the assumed supremacy of rationalism, makes Commanders distant from their own emotional expression and sometimes downright scornful of others\u2019. People with this personality type often trample others\u2019 feelings, inadvertently hurting their partners and friends, especially in emotionally charged situations. Cold and Ruthless \u2013 Their obsession with efficiency and unwavering belief in the merits of rationalism, especially professionally, makes Commanders incredibly insensitive in pursuing their goals, dismissing personal circumstances, sensitivities, and preferences as irrational and irrelevant."}]}

They want a career that fires up their curiosity and leverages their intellect, allowing them to expand their prowess as they tackle meaningful challenges and problems. If a job\u2019s description makes the average person think, Wow, that sounds hard , then it might just be a good fit for an Architect. The Early-Career Blues In the workplace, Architect personalities are often known for competence and effectiveness. Starting at the bottom of the career ladder can be frustrating for Architects. Early in their professional lives, they may be saddled with easy, routine tasks that bore them half to death. People with this personality type brim with creative and outside-the-box ideas. But with their disdain for schmoozing and workplace politics, they may struggle to earn the favor of their bosses and colleagues. The good news is that, over time, many Architects develop their abilities into a track record so good that it can\u2019t be ignored. Even when everyone around them falls prey to groupthink, people with this personality type can cut through the noise and figure out the true cause of a problem \u2013 and then fix it. As long as they don\u2019t alienate their coworkers, Architects can advance in their careers and gain the leverage that they need to see their ideas through. Finding Their Place Some personality types are drawn to jobs that require nonstop teamwork and interaction, but Architects tend to prefer positions that offer independence. By working alone or in small groups, they can make the most of their creativity without constant interruptions from curious coworkers or second-guessing supervisors. Architects really do believe that if they want something done right, they\u2019d better do it themselves. People with this personality type value resourcefulness, grit, insight, and commitment \u2013 in themselves and in others. The other side of that coin is that Architects have little respect for anyone who gets ahead based on networking or nepotism rather than merit. They believe that everyone should get their work done to the highest possible standards. So if a social butterfly at work breezes through without carrying their own weight, Architects may feel called to use their ingenuity to bring that person back down to earth \u2013 or they may be driven to work especially hard to prove their own merit by comparison. Ever Greater Challenges Architect personalities demand progress and evolution, and they love to explore new ideas. As their careers progress, they may be drawn to positions that allow them to influence a company\u2019s or organization\u2019s overall strategies. Many Architects pursue low-profile but influential roles as project managers, systems engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, management consultants, and military strategists. People with this personality type tend to be happiest in careers that allow them to innovate and experiment in ways both large and small. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that jobs in engineering, research, science, and technology are common choices for Architects. But creative fields, from architecture to musical composition to video game design, can also gratify their innovative streak. And Architects\u2019 relentless desire to get to the bottom of things can lead them to careers as auditors, cybersecurity specialists, or business analysts. Architects view a combination of rational analysis and hard work as the foundation of their success. The truth is that Architects can apply their strengths to just about any role. In a retail setting, for example, their insatiable curiosity might lead them to investigate what makes one front-of-store display more effective than another. Some careers with strong social components, such as sales or human resources, might not seem like obvious fits \u2013 but fortunately, Architects know how to look beyond the obvious. Creative and visionary, Architects want to find a career that takes advantage of their unique gifts. Few personality types, if any, can match their ability to transform complex principles into clear, actionable strategies. Architects know how much they can offer the world through their work \u2013 and their priority is to ensure that their position, whatever it may be, makes full use of their skills, knowledge, and intellect."}]}

People with this personality type take pride in getting the job done and getting it done well, rarely cutting corners or balking at a time-consuming task. This unshakable work ethic, combined with a genuine desire to be of service to others, makes Defenders invaluable in a range of careers. Shining Behind the Scenes Few personality types can match Defenders\u2019 deep appreciation of what it means to play a supporting role. Rather than seeking out the spotlight for themselves, Defenders genuinely enjoy helping and uplifting others. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Defenders tend to seek out workplaces that are collaborative and team-oriented rather than competitive and high pressure. With their natural humility, Defender personalities tend to feel especially fulfilled by careers that allow them to facilitate others\u2019 growth, healing, and progress. Teaching is a prime example of this, as are speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, medicine, and social work. Defenders\u2019 patience and ability to stay present in the moment enable them to be incredibly attuned to the needs of the people they are serving. Defenders are motivated, consistent workers, rarely losing sight of the ways in which their daily tasks can benefit others. No matter what it says on their business card, many Defenders approach their work with an eye toward helping others in practical ways. People with this personality type tend to excel at customer service, with a particular gift for listening to concerns, calming frustrations, and seeing things through to a clear resolution. These skills can also translate well into roles in human resources, IT support, hospitality, retail, office administration, library sciences, and pretty much any job that involves fielding and helping answer people\u2019s questions. Never Missing a Beat Some personality types lose steam in the face of a tedious, multifaceted task, but not Defenders. Defenders\u2019 attentiveness to detail is among their greatest strengths, and detail-oriented fields like law, accounting, data analysis, and research can be right up their alley. What\u2019s especially notable, however, is how Defenders stay connected to the human dimension of this work, rarely forgetting the impact that their spreadsheets and memos might have on real people. Meticulous and socially oriented, Defenders have a talent for remembering things about other people \u2013 a talent that can help them connect with a customer, bolster a faltering business relationship, or simply brighten a colleague\u2019s day. Despite their many gifts, Defender personalities are unlikely to demand recognition or ask for promotions, preferring to let their work speak for itself. Given their respect for tradition and security, Defenders generally have no problem with the idea of moving along in a structured hierarchy, trusting that their bosses will promote them if and when the time is right. But even the most patient Defender can become frustrated if their contributions seem to be continually overlooked. When Defenders do take the leap into management roles, they often find that their strengths are surprisingly well suited to building a cohesive, productive, and effective team. Defenders can be loyal to a fault, and they may feel guilty at the idea of moving on from their employer \u2013 even if it just isn\u2019t working out. But as long as they put themselves in a work environment that appreciates and takes full advantage of their many strengths and talents, Defenders can use their determination, precision, and altruistic energy to do even more good in this world."}]}

But adversity is often the thing that gives us character and backbone.\u201d Nicole Kidman As parents, Advocates (INFJs) have a clear vision for what matters to them: raising their children to be independent and all-around good people. Advocate personalities take their responsibilities seriously, and if they become parents, they think deeply about how they can shape their children\u2019s lives and experiences in positive ways. Parenthood isn\u2019t easy, but few Advocates expect it to be. These personalities know that many of life\u2019s most worthwhile pursuits are also the most challenging \u2013 a mindset that helps Advocates keep sight of joy and fulfillment amid the daily struggles of raising children. In many ways, parenting allows Advocates to make wonderful use of their strengths, including creativity, compassion, and the incredible strength of devotion that they feel toward those they love. Be Unique, Just Like Me Caring and loyal, Advocate parents are willing to do pretty much whatever it takes to better their children\u2019s lives. But it would be a mistake to think that parents with this personality type are pushovers. In fact, Advocates can be quite strict, because their commitment to building their children\u2019s character in the long term is rarely outweighed by momentary considerations (such as giving their child a piece of candy to help stop a tantrum). While Advocates bring many gifts to raising children, it\u2019s important to note that no parent is perfect. At times, Advocates may hold their children to unrealistic standards that don\u2019t take into account each child\u2019s personality or stage of development. For example, they might expect their child to model the same integrity and honesty that they expect from themselves, becoming dismayed whenever their child behaves in a way that they perceive to be ungenerous or unethical. Or they might push their child to be independent and creative and unique, seeing it as a sign of weakness if their child craves external structure and guidance. Advocate parents may unconsciously project a great deal of their own beliefs and values onto their children. To a child, all of these expectations can feel contradictory and impossible to fulfill \u2013 and, depending on the child\u2019s personality and their developmental stage, these expectations might actually be impossible to fulfill. In adolescence, children might rebel by flouting these standards or by espousing beliefs that go against their Advocate parent\u2019s values. In this situation, Advocates may feel that their children are criticizing or rejecting them \u2013 a hurtful thing to such a sensitive personality type. A Job Well Done Advocates strive to make sure that their children grow up with a firm understanding of the difference between right and wrong. Parents with this personality type encourage their children to fight for a cause that they believe in and to be the best they can be. Whatever age their children might be, Advocates can find a great deal of fulfillment and meaning simply in helping their children learn to be true to themselves. Ultimately, Advocate parents tend to realize that it isn\u2019t a sign of failure if their children turn out differently than they\u2019d expected. Instead, they come to see this as a sign that they\u2019ve successfully raised someone who has the ability to form their own ideals. Advocates\u2019 children often come to appreciate the combination of independence and integrity with which they were raised \u2013 especially as they get older."}]}

While very emotional individuals, they guard this sensitive core carefully, preferring to listen than to express. People with the Adventurer personality type focus instead on their partners, with little interest in dictating the mood of a situation with their own feelings. While this can sometimes be frustrating, if they are accepted for who they are, Adventurers prove to be warm, enthusiastic partners. Things are unlikely to ever grow stale \u2013 even the longest-term partners can be surprised by the secrets Adventurers keep. As their relationships grow, Adventurers\u2019 partners come to find vibrancy and spontaneity to be par for the course. Adventurers may not be great long-term planners, preferring to let their partners take the lead when it comes to logic and strategy, but they almost never run out of things to do in the present. Also caring and loyal, Adventurers love finding ways to surprise their partners in fun little ways. There\u2019s also a sense of practicality to Adventurers\u2019 unpredictability \u2013 if anyone is going to cancel a planned trip to stay home with a partner who suddenly got the flu as a gesture of affection, it is Adventurer personalities. Spending time with their partners is something Adventurers really enjoy, and they want their partners to know that they are cared for and special. A Tender Heart It\u2019s important for their partners to make it clear that this love and attention is valued. Adventurers would never ask for such thanks, but it can really hurt their feelings if they don\u2019t hear it. Such expressions don\u2019t have to be verbal \u2013 Adventurers believe in actions, not words \u2013 but it\u2019s crucial that they know their feelings are shared. On the other side of the spectrum, there are few types more vulnerable to criticism and conflict, and it\u2019s necessary to provide a certain level of emotional support. If they do feel appreciated, Adventurers are more than happy to reciprocate in any way they know how. People with the Adventurer personality type are very sensual, and in no aspect of their lives is this clearer than in their sex lives. Intimacy is an opportunity for Adventurers to satisfy their partners, and they involve every sense available in enjoying these moments. Adventurers may be shy in public, but alone with a partner they trust, the masks come off \u2013 few people get to see this side, and it\u2019s always a pleasant surprise. Love From the Soul Feelings and emotions underpin every aspect of Adventurers\u2019 relationships, alongside not just a tendency towards, but a need for, fresh possibilities. Adventurer personalities are not to be forced into anything, and rushing long-term commitments is a sure way to scare them off. If Adventurers can\u2019t feel excited in wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d every morning, they may find themselves wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d Still, developing some skill with planning can be a healthy area of growth for Adventurers. Learning to be a little more comfortable with voicing their feelings and communicating more clearly is something their partners can also help with. In any case, sharing the Observant (S) trait usually smooths out the more challenging aspects of mutual understanding, and relationships with people who have the Extraverted (E) and Judging (J) traits helps Adventurers to learn and grow in real, attainable ways."}]}

Logicians are unusual personalities with unique perspectives on the world, and few work environments are designed with them in mind. But with a little ingenuity, Logicians can find work that takes full advantage of their strengths \u2013 including creativity, a passion for ideas, and an innovative spirit. These qualities, like so many things about this personality type, are rare. As a result, Logicians can \u2013 with a little effort \u2013 find ways to stand out in a wide range of fields. Called to Explore Logicians long for exploration, but not in any conventional way. They find themselves drawn to the realms of theories and ideas, eager to delve beneath the surface of everyday life and investigate the mysteries of the universe. For Logician personalities, an ideal workday involves tackling difficult, seemingly unsolvable problems \u2013 whether that takes the form of managing a pet store or theorizing about parallel universes. With their curious spirits, Logicians can find the beauty in concepts that might make other personality types\u2019 eyes glaze over. Logicians are well represented among mathematicians, analysts, researchers, and scientists, particularly in more abstract fields such as physics. Jobs in engineering and technology can also be a match, especially if they allow room for creativity \u2013 Logicians would much rather pioneer new approaches than spend their days implementing someone else\u2019s work. That said, Logicians needn\u2019t limit themselves to technical fields. Their talent for analysis and research can be invaluable in pretty much any line of work \u2013 and Logicians have the flexibility to shine even in careers that might not seem like an obvious match. Any job that allows these personalities to invent or experiment with new processes \u2013 from teaching to management to merchandising \u2013 can give them endless gratification. Deeper Motivations At times, Logicians may be difficult for their colleagues to understand. Unlike many personality types, Logicians aren\u2019t motivated by a desire to impress their boss, be accepted by their coworkers, or get a fancy new job title. In fact, they\u2019re often turned off by things that motivate other workers, such as team-building exercises, watercooler chitchat, check-in meetings, or motivational speeches from managers. Instead, people with this personality type are driven by their own curiosity and their own high standards for themselves. For Logicians, \u201cgood enough\u201d is rarely good enough, and they\u2019d hate to be called average or (even worse) mediocre. But they aren\u2019t hardworking just for the sake of it, and not every task captures their attention equally. At times, they might ignore routine or administrative work in favor of pursuits that they consider more engaging or important. All Logicians really want is to immerse themselves in an interesting project, and they tend to get annoyed by anything that interrupts this focus. Few things frustrate Logicians more than dealing with overbearing bosses or waiting around for other people\u2019s input. As a result, they are often drawn to self-directed workplaces with relatively flat hierarchies. Laboratories can be an excellent match, as can pretty much any environment that allows them to carry out tasks and explore ideas without too many people looking over their shoulder. Alternatively, many Logicians maintain a sense of flexibility and independence by going the self-employed route, offering their services as consultants and freelancers. Social Cues Nearly every job posting these days requests candidates with strong people skills . Logicians might argue that people skills are overrated \u2013 and given how many fields are being revolutionized by data and technology, they may have a point. Increasingly, employers need people like Logicians who can understand complex systems and think critically. Where Logicians rarely thrive is in workplaces that require them to provide a high degree of emotional satisfaction \u2013 working as a cruise-ship massage therapist is probably not their happy place. That said, people with this personality type are nothing if not adaptable, and they can absolutely succeed in service- or people-oriented positions. In these roles, Logicians may need to keep their minds engaged by experimenting with new, more effective ways of serving their customers. Logicians may be tempted to steer clear of careers that involve social interaction, but they often find that success in any field requires at least some amount of collaborating with other people. If people with this personality type tell themselves that they can\u2019t handle jobs with a social element, then they\u2019re selling themselves short \u2013 and needlessly curtailing their options. As long as they manage to smile and shake hands just long enough to prove their skills, Logicians often find that their incisiveness and creativity are in high demand."}]}

An Adventurer (ISFP) is a person with the Introverted , Observant , Feeling , and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life, new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the moment helps them uncover exciting potentials. I change during the course of a day. I wake and I\u2019m one person, and when I go to sleep I know for certain I\u2019m somebody else. Bob Dylan Adventurers are true artists \u2013 although not necessarily in the conventional sense. For this personality type, life itself is a canvas for self-expression. From what they wear to how they spend their free time, Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect who they are as unique individuals. And every Adventurer is certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and eager to try new things, people with this personality often have a fascinating array of passions and interests. With their exploratory spirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, Adventurers can be among the most interesting people you\u2019ll ever meet. The only irony? Unassuming and humble, Adventurers tend to see themselves as \u201cjust doing their own thing,\u201d so they may not even realize how remarkable they really are. The Beauty of an Open Mind Adventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality types thrive on strict schedules and routines \u2013 but not Adventurers. Adventurers take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment. And they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for the unexpected \u2013 with the result that many of their most cherished memories are of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves or with their loved ones. This flexible mindset makes Adventurers remarkably tolerant and open-minded. These personalities genuinely love living in a world filled with all kinds of people \u2013 even people who disagree with them or choose radically different lifestyles. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that Adventurers are unusually open to changing their minds and rethinking their opinions. If any personality type believes in giving something (or someone) a second chance, it\u2019s Adventurers. Adventurers want to live in a world where they \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 have the freedom to live as they see fit, without judgment. That said, Adventurers\u2019 go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides. People with this personality type may struggle to set long-term plans \u2013 let alone stick with them. As a result, Adventurers tend to have a pretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often worry about letting other people down. Adventurers may find that adding a little structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel more capable and organized \u2013 without quashing their independent spirits. Living in Harmony In their relationships, Adventurers are warm, friendly, and caring, taking wholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest. But make no mistake: this is an Introverted personality type, meaning that Adventurers need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing with others. This alone time is what allows Adventurers to reestablish a sense of their own identity \u2013 in other words, to reconnect with who they truly are. Unless they take time for themselves, Adventurers can end up feeling lost in the tide of everyday life, constantly reacting to external circumstances instead of making their own way. Creative and free-spirited, Adventurers march to the beat of their own drum, and it would be easy to assume that they don\u2019t particularly worry what other people think of them. But this isn\u2019t the case \u2013 Adventurers are thoughtful and perceptive, able to pick up on people\u2019s unspoken feelings and opinions, and it can upset them if they don\u2019t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated. When faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for people with this personality type not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. If they encounter harsh or seemingly unfair criticism, they may even lose their tempers in spectacular fashion. But there\u2019s good news, too: Adventurers live in the present, and they know that they don\u2019t need to dwell on past hurts or frustrations. Rather than focusing on how things could be different, people with this personality type have an incredible capacity for appreciating what\u2019s right about life just as it is. Everywhere they look, Adventurers can find sources of beauty and enjoyment that other people might miss \u2013 and this perspective is just one of the many gifts that they share with the world."}]}

This gives them a knack for spotting unexpected patterns and connections that other personality types might overlook. Original \u2013 Thanks to their unrelenting imagination, Logicians can come up with creative, counterintuitive ideas that wouldn\u2019t occur to most people. Not all of these ideas are feasible, of course, but Logicians\u2019 willingness to think outside the box can produce remarkable innovations. Open-Minded \u2013 Logicians are driven by curiosity and an intense desire to learn everything that they can. People with this personality type tend to be receptive to new ideas and ways of doing things \u2013 as long as those ideas are supported by sound reasoning. Curious \u2013 These personalities are always casting about for new pursuits, hobbies, and areas of research. One week, they might be obsessed with geophysics, and the next, they might lose themselves in videos about guitar building. When inspiration strikes, Logicians go all in on their newfound interest, learning everything that they can. Objective \u2013 Logicians care about the truth. Rather than taking comfort in ideology or received ideas, they want to understand what\u2019s really going on beneath the surface of things. As a result, they can be relied upon to combat bias and misinformation, even when it isn\u2019t easy to do so \u2013 and they expect other people to be honest with them in return. Logician (INTP) Weaknesses Disconnected \u2013 Logicians can get lost in their own train of thought, even when they\u2019re with other people. When these personalities finally resurface with something to say, they may find that the conversation has moved on without them. This can cause them to feel disconnected from other people, especially in large social gatherings. Insensitive \u2013 People with this personality type see rationality as the key to a better, happier world. At times, they may underestimate the importance of such irrational values as emotion, compassion, etiquette, and tradition. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as insensitive or unkind, even though their intentions are generally good. Dissatisfied \u2013 Logicians can\u2019t help but imagine how things could be better than they already are. These personalities are constantly on the lookout for problems to solve, topics to learn, and new ways to approach things. Taken too far, this mindset can become overwhelming, with Logicians constantly trying to reinvent the wheel rather than reliably addressing their needs and responsibilities. Impatient \u2013 Logicians take pride in their knowledge and in sharing their ideas. When it comes to explaining their rationale, however, they aren\u2019t always patient. If their conversation partner doesn\u2019t follow along or seem sufficiently interested, Logicians may give up with a dismissive \u201cnever mind.\u201d Perfectionistic \u2013 Logicians want to get things done, but their quest for perfection can get in the way. At times, these personalities may get so lost in analyzing various options that they never reach a decision. They may also give up on projects that don\u2019t match the ideal vision in their mind."}]}

Tasks aren\u2019t simply abandoned because they\u2019ve become difficult or boring \u2013 people with the Executive personality type take them up when they are the right thing to do, and they will be finished so long as they remain the right thing to do. Strong-willed \u2013 A strong will makes this dedication possible, and Executives don\u2019t give up their beliefs because of simple opposition. Executives defend their ideas and principles relentlessly, and must be proven clearly and conclusively wrong for their stance to budge. Direct and Honest \u2013 Executives trust facts far more than abstract ideas or opinions. Straightforward statements and information are king, and Executive personalities return the honesty (whether it\u2019s wanted or not). Loyal, Patient and Reliable \u2013 Executives work to exemplify truthfulness and reliability, considering stability and security very important. When Executives say they\u2019ll do something, they keep their word, making them very responsible members of their families, companies and communities. Enjoy Creating Order \u2013 Chaos makes things unpredictable, and unpredictable things can\u2019t be trusted when they are needed most \u2013 with this in mind, Executives strive to create order and security in their environments by establishing rules, structures and clear roles. Excellent Organizers \u2013 This commitment to truth and clear standards makes Executives capable and confident leaders. People with this personality type have no problem distributing tasks and responsibilities to others fairly and objectively, making them excellent administrators. Executive Weaknesses Inflexible and Stubborn \u2013 The problem with being so fixated on what works is that Executives too often dismiss what might work better. Everything is opinion until proven, and Executive personalities are reluctant to trust an opinion long enough for it to have that chance. Uncomfortable with Unconventional Situations \u2013 Executives are strong adherents to tradition and when suddenly forced to try unvetted solutions, they become uncomfortable and stressed. New ideas suggest that their methods weren\u2019t good enough, and abandoning what has always worked before in favor of something that may yet fail risks their image of reliability. Judgmental \u2013 Executives have strong convictions about what is right, wrong, and socially acceptable. Executives\u2019 compulsion to create order often extends to all things and everyone, ignoring the possibility that there are two right ways to get things done. Executives do not hesitate to let these \u201cdeviants\u201d know what they think, considering it their duty to set things right. Too Focused on Social Status \u2013 Executives take pride in the respect of their friends, colleagues and community and while difficult to admit, are very concerned with public opinion. Executives (especially Turbulent ones) can get so caught up in meeting others\u2019 expectations that they fail to address their own needs. Difficult to Relax \u2013 This need for respect fosters a need to maintain their dignity, which can make it difficult to cut loose and relax for risk of looking the fool, even in good fun. Difficulty Expressing Emotion \u2013 This is all evidence of Executives\u2019 greatest weakness: expressing emotions and feeling empathy. People with the Executive personality type get so caught up in the facts and most effective methods that they forget to think of what makes others happy, or of their sensitivity. A detour can be breathtakingly beautiful, a joy for the family, but Executives may only see the consequence of arriving at their destination an hour late, hurting their loved ones by rejecting the notion too harshly."}]}

Their sense of responsibility and honor blends well with a tradition that has been in place since time immemorial: to raise one\u2019s children to be respected, contributing members of home and society. As with most commitments, Logisticians do not take their roles as parents lightly, and will make it their work to ensure that this tradition is upheld to the highest standard. This doesn\u2019t always come easily for their children though, as Logisticians tend to be strict, with high standards and expectations. Logistician personalities establish stable, clearly structured environments for their children, always with an eye on helping them to develop a sense of place in society, and to fulfill useful roles. A clear sense of hierarchy is a part of developing this identity, and Logisticians work just as much to ensure an appropriate respect for authority as they do with family and societal structure. All this loyalty, devotion and structure are of little use though when Logisticians\u2019 children need the warmth of emotional support. While Logisticians can be sensitive towards those they care about in their own way, it\u2019s hard for younger children and especially adolescents to recognize this tough love for the love that it is. Often Logisticians need to rely on a more sensitive partner to fill this role and mediate between rational purpose and the more ethereal sense of emotional well-being. Leading by Principle People with the Logistician personality type are strongly principled, valuing patience and hard work, qualities children often struggle with. Nevertheless, Logisticians\u2019 children are expected to meet these standards and share these values, for their own good. This approach often bears its fruit in the long run, but Logisticians must keep in mind that their approach creates natural barriers and distance that often leave their children wondering if they\u2019re on the same team. Taken too far, or with mutual stubbornness, this may even set in as a permanent state in the relationship, something both Logistician parents and their children ultimately regret. It is best for Logisticians to embrace and hold to their own values, but to also recognize that each person has their own goals, and to meet their children halfway in attaining theirs. Combining their natural devotion and purpose with this flexibility in support of their children\u2019s own vision leads to a sense of mutual respect and accomplishment that any Logistician parent would be proud of."}]}

When it comes to social fulfillment, they aren\u2019t satisfied by casual interactions with colleagues or classmates. Advocate personalities crave authentic, meaningful friendships \u2013 friendships that allow them to share their dreams, bare their souls, and feel understood and accepted for who they are. And if that means having just one or two confidants rather than a wide circle of acquaintances, so be it. While Advocates may seem quiet or reserved to the world at large, they absolutely light up around their close friends. Few things bring them more pleasure or delight than talking through their passions, interests, and beliefs with a kindred spirit. People with this personality type enjoy the pleasure of their own company, but Advocates still find it liberating to let their guard down and be completely and utterly themselves with a friend they know they can trust. Searching for a Heart of Gold Advocates are known for having great expectations \u2013 not just for themselves but also for their friendships. High on this list of expectations is authenticity.

And it\u2019s hard for people with this personality type to respect someone who won\u2019t be honest with them in return \u2013 let alone anyone who can\u2019t be honest with themselves. Another expectation that Advocates bring to their friendships is mutual support and growth. Having fun together is wonderful, but for these personalities, it isn\u2019t quite enough. Advocates want to surround themselves with friends who inspire them to learn and expand and improve themselves. For them, the surest way for two friends to deepen their bond is by helping each other move forward on their respective life missions. In friendship, Advocates aren\u2019t just searching for someone to spend time with. They want to find a soul mate \u2013 someone who resonates with their passions and their convictions. This is a tall order, and Advocates may feel that it\u2019s difficult to meet the sort of friends they\u2019re seeking. Because their personality type is so rare, Advocates may meet relatively few people who really remind them of themselves. As a result, they may worry that they need to settle for less-than-fulfilling friendships \u2013 or else accept being alone. Loyalty and Authenticity Fortunately, people with this personality type are more than capable of finding the types of friends they long to meet \u2013 they might just have to devote additional energy to it. Sometimes these friends may be hiding in plain sight, among acquaintances whom Advocates simply don\u2019t know all that well. This personality type is known for having astute first impressions of other people, but even Advocates can miss the deeper potentials of the people they encounter on a daily basis. When they give these people a chance, Advocates may find that they share values and attitudes that make them compatible on a deeper level. Once they do find genuine friendships, Advocates make loyal, caring companions. At times they may even be surprised by the fierceness of the loyalty and devotion they feel toward their friends. Few situations in life bring out Advocates\u2019 bravery and commitment quite like the opportunity to stand up for a friend who needs them. With their trademark warmth and enthusiasm, Advocate personalities support their friends\u2019 efforts to grow and expand their lives. Ultimately, the only way to be counted among Advocates\u2019 true friends is to be authentic, honest, and real. Over the years, Advocates may end up with just a few true friendships rather than a wide circle of casual acquaintances. But as long as those friendships are built on a richness of mutual understanding, Advocates wouldn\u2019t have it any other way."}]}

A Logistician (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted , Observant , Thinking , and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and carry them out with methodical purpose. I\u2019d be more frightened by not using whatever abilities I\u2019d been given. I\u2019d be more frightened by procrastination and laziness. DENZEL WASHINGTON Logisticians pride themselves on their integrity. People with this personality type mean what they say, and when they commit to doing something, they make sure to follow through. This personality type makes up a good portion of the overall population, and while Logisticians may not be particularly flashy or attention-seeking, they do more than their share to keep society on a sturdy, stable foundation. In their families and their communities, Logisticians often earn respect for their reliability, their practicality, and their ability to stay grounded and logical, even in the most stressful situations. In a world where many people shirk their responsibilities or say what they think others want to hear, Logisticians stand out as dedicated, responsible, and honest. A Life of Integrity The core of Logisticians\u2019 self-respect comes from a sense of personal integrity. People with this personality type believe that there is a right way to proceed in any situation \u2013 and that anyone who pretends otherwise is probably trying to bend the rules to suit their own purposes. Logisticians have a deep respect for structure and tradition, and they are often drawn to organizations, workplaces, and educational settings that offer clear hierarchies and expectations. For many Logisticians, a lack of structure offers not freedom, but chaos. People with the Logistician personality type rarely hesitate to take responsibility for their actions and choices. Generally speaking, they are quick to own up to their own mistakes, admitting the truth even if it doesn\u2019t make them look good. To Logisticians, honesty is far more important than showmanship, and they\u2019d rather satisfy their own conscience than lie to impress someone else. Because they strive to meet their obligations no matter what, Logistician personalities are often baffled by people who fail to hold themselves to the same standard. At times, Logisticians might unfairly misjudge people who can\u2019t match their rigorous self-control \u2013 suspecting that someone is being lazy or dishonest when that person might actually be coping with other challenges. Even if Logisticians don\u2019t speak these judgments aloud, their disdain can come through regardless, earning them a reputation for being somewhat strict or unempathetic. Picking Up the Slack Logisticians\u2019 dedication is an admirable quality, and it drives many of their accomplishments. But it can also become a weakness that other people take advantage of. With their strong work ethic and sense of duty, Logisticians may routinely find themselves shouldering other people\u2019s responsibilities. Even if they don\u2019t complain about the situation, Logisticians can end up exhausted or discouraged if they\u2019re constantly expected \u2013 or taking it upon themselves \u2013 to pick up the slack for their colleagues, friends, or loved ones. Logisticians may find themselves doing other people\u2019s work \u2013 and not getting credit for it. Logisticians aren\u2019t known for expressing their emotions readily, but that doesn\u2019t mean that people with this personality type don\u2019t feel frustration or resentment when they\u2019re pulling more than their weight. And unless they make sure that their relationships are balanced and sustainable, Logisticians may end up compromising the very stability that they feel called to protect. The good news is that, by learning to set appropriate boundaries and speak up when they\u2019re overstretched, Logisticians can offer the world the full benefit of their many gifts, including their clarity, their loyalty, and their dependability."}]}

They are not talkative, or particularly playful in their affection. What Logistician friends are is loyal, trustworthy, honorable and dependable. Others may come and go with the ups and downs of life, but Logisticians stay by their friends\u2019 sides no matter what, with a deepness of commitment that other types may not even believe is possible. The Gift of Loyalty Logisticians are a very methodical personality type, and this loyalty isn\u2019t given away lightly. Often slow to make friends, Logisticians usually end up with a smaller circle, but they consider that circle to represent a promise to be there for the people they care about, and Logisticians\u2019 promises are not easily broken. Expressing emotional affection isn\u2019t one of Logisticians\u2019 stronger skills, but they nevertheless find ways to show it. As Socrates said, \u201cTo be is to do\u201d, and Logisticians\u2019 follow-through, their willingness to take action as a show of support, stands in for their words. These actions convey a sensitivity that many fail to see, but it is a quality that Logisticians\u2019 friends come to admire and depend on in the long years of their friendships. But all of this sounds terribly serious, and indeed it only shows the one side of Logisticians and their approach to their friendships. The other side knows how to stop being quite so staid, and especially in the company of joyful and talkative Extraverts (E), Logisticians enjoy relaxing and having fun with a good discussion about work, life, and current events. People with the Logistician personality type don\u2019t like conflict, and this applies to how they select their friends as well. Seeking out friends with similar principles and opinions, Logisticians most often befriend other Sentinels personalities, who are likely to share their perspective and world vision. While they are unlikely to become friends with substantially different types \u2013 it simply takes too much energy to bridge the communication gap \u2013 Logistician personalities still recognize and appreciate others\u2019 strengths and qualities. Better Together In fact, as if to prove the point, Logisticians almost always have at least one Intuitive (N) friend in their inner circle, despite the disconnect the two perspectives bring. These are very much relationships built not on mutual understanding, but out of respect for their mutual differences. Logisticians marvel at Intuitives\u2019 breadth of thought, being very much in tune with their own intelligence, while Intuitives admire Logisticians\u2019 realism and dependability, something they are often hard-pressed to find in themselves. Knowledge, as always, is the great equalizer."}]}

For these personalities, a job isn\u2019t satisfying if it doesn\u2019t offer a deeper sense of purpose \u2013 no matter how good the salary is. The good news is that people with this personality type can use their creativity and determination to find work that suits their needs in just about any field. In fact, Advocates have trouble deciding which job is best for them because they\u2019re able to imagine so many possibilities. They may see half a dozen wildly different paths forward, each with its own set of rewards. This can be exciting but also stress-inducing, because picking just one means letting go of so many others. Advocates may even feel a sense of loss when so many doors close because one was selected. The Search for Purpose For Advocate personalities, jobs that involve helping and connecting with people can be deeply satisfying. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that many Advocates gravitate toward work as counselors, therapists, psychologists, social workers, teachers, yoga instructors, and spiritual leaders. They may enjoy service industry positions that allow them to interact directly and build genuine relationships with their customers. Careers in health care can also be rewarding options, including occupations such as nursing, physical or occupational therapy, medicine, nutrition, or more holistic paths such as acupuncture. Many Advocates are passionate communicators. This explains why they are often drawn to careers in writing, creating many popular books, blogs, stories, video games, and screenplays. For people with this personality type, the opportunity to tell stories for a living can be nothing short of a dream come true. Other Advocates might pursue music, photography, design, illustration, or fine art. Even if these artistic pursuits aren\u2019t their primary job, many Advocates find that creative side hustles offer a much-needed outlet for the themes and ideas that occupy their imaginations. Nonprofit workplaces, from museums to nature centers to food pantries, also hold a special appeal. With their focus on serving the community rather than drawing a profit, these organizations can be a natural fit for Advocate personalities. But even in workplaces that are very much for-profit, Advocates can find ways to direct their energy and creativity toward helping others. No matter what it says on their business cards, Advocates\u2019 insight can enable them to spot unusual patterns and come up with outside-the-box solutions, creating real change in others\u2019 lives. A Sense of Mission Advocates are incredibly versatile, but some work environments may rub them the wrong way. This is especially true of workplaces that offer little independence or agency, forcing employees to adhere to rigid, repetitive protocols without regard for their individual needs or strengths. People with this personality type may also chafe at the criticism and pressure that come with cutthroat, competitive work environments. For this reason, many Advocates seek out more flexible, autonomous positions \u2013 or branch off altogether to start their own businesses. They may also find it gratifying to create bridges between seemingly disparate professional fields \u2013 for example, by writing about psychology or by being an environmental lawyer. Such hybrid careers can offer plenty of opportunities for Advocates to exercise their creativity and their love of learning. Advocates tend to feel stifled unless their work allows them the freedom to act according to their conscience, their creativity, and their own common sense. In truth, Advocate personalities can do well in any field. To be truly happy, however, they need to find work that aligns with their values and allows them some independence. Advocates crave opportunities to learn and grow alongside the people they are helping. When this happens, Advocates may finally feel that they are fulfilling their life\u2019s mission, contributing to the well-being of humanity on a personal level."}]}

Imaginative and open-minded, these personalities aren\u2019t afraid to venture beyond their comfort zones in search of new ideas, experiences, and adventures. Perceptive \u2013 To people with this personality type, no one is unimportant \u2013 which might explain how they can pick up on even the subtlest shifts in another person\u2019s mood or expression. Because they\u2019re so sensitive to other people\u2019s feelings and needs, Campaigners can make full use of their caring, considerate nature. Enthusiastic \u2013 When something captures their imagination and inspires them, Campaigners want to share it with anyone who will listen. And they\u2019re just as eager to hear other people\u2019s ideas and opinions \u2013 even if those thoughts are wildly different from their own. Excellent Communicators \u2013 Campaigners brim with things to say, but they can be caring listeners as well. This gives them a nearly unmatched ability to have positive and enjoyable conversations with all sorts of people \u2013 even people who aren\u2019t particularly sociable or agreeable. Festive \u2013 Campaigners may live for deep, meaningful conversations, but they can also be spontaneous and lighthearted. These personalities know how to find fun and joy in the present moment \u2013 and few things give them more pleasure than sharing their joy with others. Good-Natured \u2013 All of these strengths come together to form a person who is warmhearted and approachable, with an altruistic spirit and a friendly disposition. Campaigners strive to get along with pretty much everyone, and their circles of acquaintances and friends often stretch far and wide. Campaigner (ENFP) Weaknesses People-Pleasing \u2013 Most Campaigners are uncomfortable with the prospect of being disliked. To maintain the peace, they may compromise on things that matter to them or allow other people to treat them poorly. And when they fail to win someone over, they might lose sleep trying to figure out what to do about it. Unfocused \u2013 The thrill of a new project \u2013 especially one that involves collaborating with other people \u2013 can bring out the best in Campaigners. But this personality type is known for having ever-evolving interests, meaning that Campaigners may find it challenging to maintain discipline and focus over the long term. Disorganized \u2013 Campaigners\u2019 enthusiasm is legendary, but it doesn\u2019t extend to everything. Specifically, people with this personality type may try to avoid boring, practical matters, such as chores, maintenance, or paperwork. The resulting sense of disorganization can become a major source of stress in their lives. Overly Accommodating \u2013 Campaigner personalities feel called to uplift others, and they may find themselves saying yes whenever anyone asks them for guidance or help. But unless they set boundaries, even the most energetic Campaigners can become overcommitted, with too little time and energy to tackle the necessities of their own lives. Overly Optimistic \u2013 Optimism can be among this personality type\u2019s key strengths. But Campaigners\u2019 rosy outlook can lead them to make well-intentioned but naive decisions, such as believing people who haven\u2019t earned their trust. This trait can also make it difficult for Campaigners to accept hard but necessary truths \u2013 and to share those truths with others. Restless \u2013 With their positive, upbeat attitude, Campaigners rarely seem upset or dissatisfied on the outside. But their inner idealism can leave them with a nagging feeling that some major areas of their life just aren\u2019t good enough \u2013 whether that\u2019s their work, their home life, or their relationships."}]}

It impacts the way each thinks, acts, and responds to their worlds to a significant extent. Assertive Advocates are more likely to be confident and relaxed. Turbulent Advocates are likely to question themselves more and are ordinarily more sensitive to stressors. To discover more about the general differences between Assertive and Turbulent Identities, please visit their overview page . 74% of Assertive Advocates feel like they effectively manage the stress in their life, compared to 28% of Turbulent Advocates. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Are you a Turbulent Advocate? Check out \u201cTurbulent Advocate Superpowers\u201d at the bottom of this article for the deepest insights into who you are. Turbulent and Assertive Advocates and the People in Their Lives All Advocate individuals decide matters primarily by filtering them through their feelings, and their decisions often reflect the value they place on their morality. How they think about people and what they are going through is a defining factor for their personality type. But Turbulent Advocates are likely to turn empathizing with others up a notch when compared to Assertive Advocates. Turbulent Advocates often let their passions lead them to great accomplishments. These are fueled by their regard for the people in their lives and concern for moral and idealistic issues. They can become overly involved in the problems of others. This involvement might even generate a kind of hyper-empathy where these personalities identify too much with those they seek to help. If Turbulent Advocates become invested and then are not able to help to the degree they think they should, Turbulent self-criticism can be excessively harsh. They can sink into brooding and become miserably mired in worry and regret. 75% of Turbulent Advocates say they are prone to seeing difficulties everywhere, compared to 42% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST?\u201d SURVEY To add to this, Turbulent Advocates are more willing to exaggerate the impact of something that bothers them or hurts the people they care about. People with this personality type often interpret things as being far worse than they are. But such exaggeration is rarely on purpose or about dishonesty. It\u2019s more a reflection of their tendency to hold more negative views of things. It can genuinely reflect what they believe. But even if it comes from a good place, magnifying the problems can add unneeded stress and intensity to an already difficult situation. When the Assertive Advocates become bothered by injustice, inequality, or the problems of others, they are more likely to respond in a hopeful manner. They may pay just as much attention to any troubling concerns and human difficulties, but they refuse to become stressed by them. 35% of Turbulent Advocates feel like they are in control, even when things are going wrong, compared to 72% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST?\u201d SURVEY That doesn\u2019t mean these personalities aren\u2019t genuinely invested, or that they don\u2019t care. There are many ways, apart from fretting, to take an interest in the plight of others. Assertive Advocates are more likely than their counterparts to stay on an even emotional keel when relating to others. Rather than spending a lot of time thinking about the pain and misery some may suffer, these personality types are more likely to think in terms of plans and visions that may lead to a more positive future. They can be just as intense imagining the emergence of something good as Turbulent Advocates can be about their worries and regrets. But this optimism can, at times, have negative outcomes. Life through rose-colored glasses doesn\u2019t always promote a clear vision. Assertive Advocates might shrug off legitimately important problems that need to be addressed, choosing instead to focus on brighter things. On these occasions, they may overlook essential tasks. Turbulent Advocates are more likely to spot such things long before Assertive Advocates do. Both Turbulent and Assertive Advocates tend to elevate their friends, the people they fall in love with, and even their colleagues. These personalities generally think the best of those they value and agree with. They might not look as kindly on those who go against their sense of right and wrong or appear to be phony. However, there is a difference between the two: Assertive Advocates see things through a filter that values humanity and want to have people (in limited Introverted doses) in their lives. Turbulent Advocates, in comparison, are more likely to go beyond simply wanting people in their lives. These personalities feel more of a need for others and are more affected by what others think of them. This need for others and their opinions can help them form deep bonds with others and allows them to collaborate better when that\u2019s called for. 38% of Turbulent Advocates find it easy to make an important decision without consulting anyone first, compared to 71% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cRelying on Others\u201d SURVEY However, unlike Turbulent Advocates, Assertive Advocates are not deeply influenced by the opinions of others \u2013 perhaps, at times, to their detriment. This allows these personalities to approach the various missions in their lives with independence and in a streamlined fashion. 73% of Turbulent Advocates feel pressured to live up to a certain standard (e.g., home, car, salary), compared to 42% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cSocial Pressures\u201d SURVEY But at what point does this independence evolve into arrogance? All Introverted personality types prefer being alone \u2013 or, at most, among a small group of carefully chosen people. That said, Assertive Advocates can overplay the role of the lone wolf. These Confident Individualists can become so independent that they forget the needs and wishes of others. Turbulent Advocates can go the other way \u2013 constantly looking for approval, stifling their individuality, and thwarting their efforts as they wait for all who matter to look kindly on their actions and ideas. Pleasing everyone is a rare accomplishment in life, and pursuing it has stalled a lot of people in their tracks. 93% of Turbulent Advocates are often afraid of being rejected by other people, compared to 52% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cRelying on Others\u201d SURVEY Change, Regret, and Advocate Identity Differences Because of their shared Judging personality trait, both types of Advocates prefer routine and predictability. Neither particularly likes to be caught by surprise. However, Assertive Advocates are much more likely to accept an unusual turn in events, and they somewhat more readily buy into unorthodox ideas and people. They tend to be somewhat more adventurous than their Turbulent counterparts \u2013 probably by virtue of their confidence. Turbulent Advocates, as part of their quest for ongoing improvements, are likely to embrace change, but only within reason. People with this personality type like to have some control over it and to have some guarantee that it is the right change at the right moment. They are likely to take fewer risks than their Assertive counterparts. 87% of Turbulent Advocates find it hard not to let a stressful event negatively affect them, compared to 47% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Advocate personalities all share profound regard for the past. They tend to remember the way things have unfolded in their lives deeply and passionately. They glean lessons for the future from their bygone days. However, Assertive Advocates are much less bothered by regrets when their pasts have been rocky, whereas Turbulent Advocates may cling tightly to the memories of such disappointments and missteps. 86% of Turbulent Advocates often feel regret, compared to 48% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cREGRET: GENERAL ATTITUDES\u201d SURVEY Regret can color Turbulent Advocates\u2019 future actions either positively or negatively: positively, if they are motivated to make up for past missteps; negatively, if these personalities become caught up in guilt or anger. This can be especially devastating if they believe they have harmed others. Because regret does not impact them as much, Assertive Advocates may be less driven to fix past mistakes. If they can just brush off their failures as unimportant, they may not learn critical lessons that can be best taught by trial and error. This may leave these personalities repeating their mistakes more often than they might like. 89% of Turbulent Advocates often catch themselves dwelling on past mistakes, compared to 61% of Assertive Advocates. \u201cThought Patterns\u201d SURVEY Summary of Differences Both personality types are concerned with other people, but Assertive Advocates are likely to be more hopeful, and Turbulent Advocates to focus on the difficult parts of a problem. Turbulent Advocates are often fueled by their worries and concerns, and these can be used to make significant progress. Both Assertive and Turbulent Advocates can get caught up in the drama of life, but those who are Turbulent are likely to be affected by it more. Stress and regret affect the Assertive Advocate individuals less, but this should not be confused with their not caring. Because their regrets weigh on them more, Turbulent Advocates are more likely to learn from their mistakes than Assertive Advocates. Assertive Advocates are less influenced by the opinions of others than Turbulent Advocates. However, paying too little or too much attention to the opinions of others carries its own difficulties. Assertive Advocates are more likely to want people in their lives, while Turbulent Advocates may feel they need people in their lives. The same but different \u2013 that\u2019s what we discover when we explore Assertive and Turbulent Identities in a single personality type. For Advocates, this means they share the same passion, the same concern for others, the same sense of order, and the same level of conviction about right and wrong. However, it also means each personality type has a somewhat different perspective regarding the metaphorical glass. Is it half-full or half-empty? To what degree do they respond to other people and events, and to what degree do they move forward despite them? It\u2019s all part of the journey of self-exploration."}]}

Virtuosos thrive on diversity and unpredictability, on wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s next?\u201d every morning. This makes Virtuosos one of the most mysterious personality types, but also one of the most versatile in the professional world. Virtuosos are born problem-solvers with an unwavering focus on practical solutions (though perhaps not always solutions to practical problems). No other type is quite as fascinated by how things work, how tools can be used, and how facts can be put together to create immediate and satisfying results. This combination of curiosity and hands-on vigor make people with the Virtuoso personality type excellent mechanics, engineers, graphic designers, and forensic scientists. Abstract theory and purely academic work that will never see the light of real use hold little interest for Virtuosos. \u201cPractical\u201d is the word of the day. But it\u2019s not the practicality of routine administration that Virtuosos crave \u2013 they need variety and action, perhaps even a little adrenaline in their work. Highly structured environments leave Virtuoso personalities bored and tired. Jobs that focus on crisis response, such as firefighters, paramedics, detectives, pilots and police officers seem made for Virtuosos. Perhaps most important to Virtuosos though, is the feeling that they aren\u2019t stuck. The freedom to wander, the freedom to declare their own schedules, their own responsibilities, their own environments \u2013 nearly every other consideration pales by comparison to the need to avoid inflexible commitments and stodgy colleagues. While this can be a significant hurdle to overcome in traditional employment, it is the chiefest allure of entrepreneurship. Embracing the Unpredictable Nearly any creative or constructive skill or interest can be offered on a freelance basis or on a business-owner\u2019s own terms, be it blogger, systems analyst, athlete or driver. Virtuosos need to face down their weak long-term planning abilities and preference for instant results in order to make this path work, but livelihoods can be made selling bits and crafts in their free time. It\u2019s also possible to find more traditional work to satisfy these needs, and forest ranger is a sought-after line of work for many Virtuosos. Virtuosos have a natural skill with troubleshooting, a relaxed, self-confident nature and a results-oriented focus. People with this personality type understand that risk equals reward, and as long as they can use that understanding with maturity, rather than just kicking the ant\u2019s nest whenever they get bored, they are highly desirable in any dynamic field or environment."}]}

However, one thing people with the Debater personality type love more than just about anything is a good challenge, a problem to fix, even if it comes to addressing their own weaknesses. Debaters take their roles as parents seriously, and they are bound to be affected profoundly by this development in their lives \u2013 if anyone is able to take an outside influence, like their children, and use that influence to address their own faults, it is Debaters. Raising Free Thinkers From the beginning Debaters\u2019 distaste for rules and regulations is evident, and they are likely to give their young children the freedom necessary to explore on their own. Independence is one of Debaters\u2019 greatest needs, and they feel that no person is complete without an independent mind. Debater personalities create relaxed, unorthodox environments for their children, founded on enthusiasm and the joy of discovery through the development of reason, not heavily structured settings designed merely to be safe. As their children grow and develop, Debaters encourage them to think independently and voice objections, opinions and alternatives. But unlike Diplomat parents, who encourage their children to express their thoughts in terms of feelings and needs, Debaters teach their children to approach these options from a position of impartiality and logic, to state what is more effective rather than what would make them feel good. As in other relationships, this quality of emotional inaccessibility is where Debaters struggle. As their children grow into adolescence and learn to find a balance in healthy emotional expression, people with the Debater personality type may find themselves exasperated. While always up for a good debate on just about any subject, Debaters often need their partners\u2019 help in managing more emotional outbursts and arguments. Debaters are more able than most, but even they have their limits and rules when it comes to vocal conflict. Finding a Better Way Luckily, Debater personalities recognize what\u2019s at stake: they want their children to grow into smart, independent, honest adults. To convey those values, Debaters know that they need, like with any other debate, to communicate in terms that are accessible to all sides. If that means learning how to use the tools of emotional expression and appeals, and in so doing becoming more emotionally expressive in real, personal terms as well, so be it."}]}

But rather than the sort of people-oriented helpfulness that Diplomat personality types bring to the table, Debater personalities are focused on developing solutions to interesting and diverse technical and intellectual problems. Debaters are a versatile personality type, and while it may take time for them to get to a point where they can fully utilize their skillset and qualities, they are likely to find that those qualities translate well into pretty much any career that so much as piques their interest. If there\u2019s anything Debaters love, it\u2019s flexing their mental muscles, and any environment that lets them devise new approaches, new ideas and new projects, that allows them to push the limits of their creativity, will benefit strongly from what Debaters bring to the table. Not every career allows this level of unbridled brainpower, but there are those that demand nothing but: entrepreneurship, engineering, even acting and photography. So long as Debaters are honest with themselves about their strengths and weaknesses, they can thrive in most any career that is in need of a new line of thinking. The Gift of Curiosity All this intellectual power can be intimidating, but unlike their Introverted (I) cousins, people with the Debater personality type have the added benefit of being excellent communicators, in the written word but especially in face-to-face conversation. Though they dislike the constraints of managing others (and of being managed), this social adaptability allows Debaters to be natural leaders, showing the way forward and inspiring others with sound logic and intellectual prowess. While others may object to these plans with emotional considerations or general resistance to change, things Debaters place little value in, these competing comments are usually outmaneuvered by Debater personalities\u2019 deft arguments and subtly shifting goals. The best careers reward intellectual competency and curiosity, allowing Debaters to utilize their never-ending flow of ideas productively by affording a degree of spontaneity in how they engage their intellectual pursuits. People with the Debater personality type value knowledge, rational thought and insight very highly, and they make brilliant lawyers, psychologists, systems analysts and scientists. It\u2019s even possible for Debaters to thrive as sales representatives, as they rationalize purchase decisions that may otherwise seem discretionary \u2013 so long as their managers know to give them the space they need to work their magic. An Independent Spirit Really it all comes down to a sense of personal freedom, for Debaters to know that they are allowed to apply themselves fully to understanding and solving the problems that interest them, without getting bogged down by social politics and trying to figure out what makes other people \u201ctick\u201d. Routine, structure and formal rules all feel like unnecessary hindrances to Debaters, and they may find that their best careers yet allow them to engage their intellectual pursuits on their own terms, as freelance consultants or software engineers. The key for Debaters is to have the patience to get to a position that allows for these freedoms, to be in an environment long enough that not just their colleagues, but their managers and, in time, their subordinates, recognize what it is that they bring to the table. Debaters have exceptional qualities \u2013 it\u2019s quantifying their achievements and skills that presents the biggest challenge. But once they\u2019ve got their foot in the door, once they\u2019ve got a willing ear higher in the hierarchy, the sky\u2019s the limit."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "INFP's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mediators are quiet, private, free spirits who view life as an endless series of idealistic possibilities waiting to be realized. They typically try to get along with others and promote harmony wherever they go. How they do that, however, depends on whether they are Assertive Mediators (INFP-A) or Turbulent Mediators (INFP-T). Identity adds nuance to the expression of the other personality traits. We explore below how that often happens. Are you a Turbulent Mediator? Check out \u201cTurbulent Mediator Superpowers\u201d at the bottom of this article for the deepest insights into who you are. The Difference Is in Too Much or Too Little When it comes to self-regard, as a group, Mediators are more likely to boost someone else\u2019s self-esteem before they tend to their own \u2013 even sometimes at their own expense. However, when Identity separates the two kinds of Mediators, a pronounced difference emerges. We find that one personality type tends not only to put others ahead of themselves, but also to be harder on themselves than the other. 85% of Assertive Mediators say they feel comfortable with themselves, compared to 40% of Turbulent Mediators. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST?\u201d SURVEY Turbulent personality types are typically not comfortable with their current lives. They often use this dissatisfaction to try to become better people. However, when applied to Mediators, this Turbulent quality spins them in a distinct direction. They are likely to use a strongly idealistic filter to assess where and how they need to improve. This drive to correct what they decide are flaws often pushes them to work hard. But idealism is a demanding standard. Turbulent Mediators are apt to ask too much of themselves and become overwhelmed. When they don\u2019t meet their unyielding (perhaps at times unreasonable) goals, they are likely to be hard on themselves. Self-criticism rings true for any Turbulent individual. But, for these personalities, their imaginations and sensitivity may magnify the damage caused by negative self-talk. Even the smallest flaw may seem more significant than it is. They are more likely to see a mistake as a reason to doubt themselves. 85% of Turbulent Mediators say they consider themselves to be lazy people, compared to 66% of Assertive Mediators. \u201cLAZINESS\u201d SURVEY For example, Turbulent Mediators are likely to describe themselves as \u201clazy\u201d more often than Assertive Mediators \u2013 and most other personality types (all except two). But a neutral assessment may reveal this to be not entirely accurate. All other things being equal, Turbulent people generally work hard to compensate for what they see as a weakness. The \u201clazy\u201d label doesn\u2019t fit, typically. The poor self-evaluation of their work ethic is just as likely the result of their negative slant as it is a measurable reality. 68% of Turbulent Mediators say they see many of their mistakes as failures, compared to 24% of Assertive Mediators. \u201cTHOUGHT PATTERNS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Mediators are more likely to see a mistake as a one-off accident or simple carelessness \u2013 as the occasional kind of thing everyone does. But they are unlikely to let it take up too much real estate in their minds. These personalities typically do the same with their flaws. They usually prefer to use their time thinking about positive possibilities. It\u2019s not that Assertive Mediators are any less idealistic or sensitive. It\u2019s just a different, less pensive expression of these qualities. They tend to filter their caring for others, as well as other things, through a rosier-colored lens. For example, a small majority of them see themselves as \u201clazy\u201d (as Prospecting personality types tend to do). It\u2019s notably less than the number of Turbulent Mediators who apply the label to themselves. But the word \u201clazy\u201d is probably not nearly as dire and filled with judgment for Assertive Mediators as it is for their Turbulent counterparts. 87% of Assertive Mediators say they feel confident to face day-to-day difficulties, compared to 48% of Turbulent Mediators. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Mediators, relying on optimism and self-assurance to inspire them, can put a lot of energy into their humanistic goals. These personalities are usually good at fostering encouragement and hope. But an automatic habit of blanketing everything with a sunny appraisal can fog over areas that need improvement. People rarely attend to the things they shrug off. Where Turbulent Mediators may ask too much of themselves, Assertive Mediators may run the danger of asking too little, if there are problems hidden behind an illusion of everything being just fine. Emotions and Outcomes 82% of Assertive Mediators say they are usually optimistic about the outcomes of the risks they take, compared to 44% of Turbulent Mediators. \u201cRISK\u201d SURVEY Mediators make their decisions via the Feeling personality trait. They choose a point of view that emphasizes empathy and caring for others. But our research shows a clear difference between the way Assertive and Turbulent Mediators live with their emotions and relate to other people. 63% of Turbulent Mediators describe themselves as prone to crying \u201coften to very often,\u201d compared to 28% of Assertive Mediators. \u201cCRYING\u201d SURVEY Outwardly expressed emotions can show up more often in Turbulent Mediators\u2019 lives than in the lives of their Assertive cousins. Crying more than others may not appear like a good thing at first glance. But any experience teaches those who are willing to learn \u2013 and Mediators are typically ready students of life. Being familiar with emotional expression can come in handy when relating to others\u2019 feelings. Experience can provide a shortcut to understanding. Sharing similar ordeals can increase the potential for kindhearted listening. 90% of Turbulent Mediators say they often feel regret, compared to 56% of Assertive Mediators. \u201cREGRET: GENERAL ATTITUDES\u201d SURVEY Assertive personalities, including Assertive Mediators, are often wrongly labeled as arrogant. Being self-important is hardly a universal characteristic of Assertive people. They may sometimes seem less invested than their intense Turbulent peers. They are subject to fewer regrets in their lives and are less likely to feel sorry or apologize for the things they do. This aura of arrogance is probably relative when considering Assertive Mediators, due to their quieter behavior. Compared to the rest of humanity, they may give the impression of being humble, but standing next to Turbulent Mediators, they may look almost brash. 76% of Turbulent Mediators think the way they express their personality changes significantly when they are at work, compared to 51% of Assertive Mediators. \u201cWORK PERSONALITY\u201d SURVEY Assertive Mediators lean more toward presenting themselves just as they are. They are not afraid of just being themselves. Their confidence makes the opinions of others less essential to their outlook and decisions. Being less likely to cave to the views of others suggests that these personalities have a greater tendency to act independently. This independent approach can allow Assertive Mediators to work unencumbered by the baggage others may try to pile on. This independence is only a problem if they take it too far. They may fail to ask for or accept feedback and advice from others at crucial times. In poll results factoring in all personality types, Assertive Mediators are above average in saying that they hesitate to ask for help even when they need it. 61% of Assertive Mediators find it easy to make important decisions without consulting anyone first, compared to 36% of Turbulent Mediators. \u201cRELYING ON OTHERS\u201d SURVEY Opinions weigh more heavily on Turbulent Mediators. Having concern for what others think is a typical quality in most Turbulent personality types. But Turbulent Mediators may feel this concern more deeply. Combine their Turbulent nature, the sensitivity that is a core feature of their type, and their ever-changing interests, and together, these features leave them always checking in with others. They often seek the views of the people in their lives to quiet or confirm their nagging doubts. As people-centric individuals with lingering uncertainty, Turbulent Mediators naturally go to others for encouragement and feedback. Since they value opinions, these personalities are also more likely to take note when people speak. Both types of Mediators tend to see themselves as good listeners, but valuing others\u2019 opinions likely adds to Turbulent Mediators\u2019 ability to pay attention. Summary Self-assessments through an idealistic lens often drive Turbulent Mediators to put in more effort than their Assertive counterparts, but it can also make them very hard on themselves. Positive impulses motivate Assertive Mediators to reach for their humanistic goals and foster hope and encouragement, but these personalities may overlook negatives/problems that need their attention. Turbulent Mediators report feeling negative emotions to a far greater extent than Assertive Mediators, but this can help increase their empathy levels. The opinions of others have less effect on Assertive Mediators and can allow them to be more independent, but it may also leave them paying less attention to valuable feedback and perspectives. Turbulent Mediators\u2019 high regard for the opinion of others potentially makes them better listeners and team players \u2013 even if in an Introverted way. The Differences Are Differences Across the Board We\u2019ve explored some of the prominent differences between Assertive and Turbulent Mediator personalities. But Identities tend to affect all parts of one\u2019s life, and the principles discussed above tend to generalize into other parts of Mediators\u2019 lives. Using the ideas we\u2019ve presented, Mediators can gain a better understanding of how they see themselves, how they approach the world, and how they interact with others. Mediators of both types can use such insights to better navigate their lives."}]}

Cheerful and good-natured, people with the Virtuoso personality type (especially Assertive ones) rarely get stressed out, preferring to go with the flow. Creative and Practical \u2013 Virtuosos are very imaginative when it comes to practical things, mechanics, and crafts. Novel ideas come easily, and they love using their hands to put them into action. Spontaneous and Rational \u2013 Combining spontaneity with logic, Virtuosos can switch mindsets to fit new situations with little effort, making them flexible and versatile individuals. Know How to Prioritize \u2013 This flexibility comes with some unpredictability, but Virtuoso personalities are able to store their spontaneity for a rainy day, releasing their energy just when it\u2019s needed most. Great in a Crisis \u2013 With all this hands-on creativity and spontaneity, it\u2019s no wonder that Virtuosos are naturals in crisis situations. People with this personality type usually enjoy a little physical risk, and they aren\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty when the situation calls for it. Relaxed \u2013 Through all this, Virtuosos are able to stay quite relaxed. They live in the moment and go with the flow, refusing to worry too much about the future. Virtuoso Weaknesses Stubborn \u2013 As easily as Virtuosos go with the flow, they can also ignore it entirely, and usually move in another direction with little apology or sensitivity. If someone tries to change Virtuosos\u2019 habits, lifestyle or ideas through criticism, they can become quite blunt in their irritation. Insensitive \u2013 Virtuosos use logic, and even when they try to meet others halfway with empathy and emotional sensitivity, it rarely seems to quite come out right, if anything is even said at all. Private and Reserved \u2013 Virtuoso personalities are notoriously difficult to get to know. They are true introverts, keeping their personal matters to themselves, and often just prefer silence to small talk. Easily Bored \u2013 Virtuosos enjoy novelty, which makes them excellent tinkerers, but much less reliable when it comes to focusing on things long-term. Once something is understood, Virtuosos tend to simply move on to something new and more interesting. Dislike Commitment \u2013 Long-term commitments are particularly onerous for Virtuosos. They prefer to take things day-by-day, and the feeling of being locked into something for a long time is downright oppressive. This can be a particular challenge in Virtuosos\u2019 romantic relationships. Risky Behavior \u2013 This stubbornness, difficulty with others\u2019 emotions, focus on the moment, and easy boredom can lead to unnecessary and unhelpful boundary-pushing, just for fun. Virtuosos have been known to escalate conflict and danger just to see where it goes, something that can have disastrous consequences for everyone around if they lose control of the situation."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ENFJ's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sometimes the core personality traits help a type mimic what it means to be Assertive or Turbulent, even when they don\u2019t possess those specific qualities. This imitation can mute their Identity differences. Turbulent Protagonists \u2019 outgoing nature can prompt them to act more boldly than the typical Turbulent personality type. Their Judging trait helps them value and seek predictability \u2013 which, in turn, provides them with confidence as they seek a sure thing. As a result, Turbulent Protagonists may not always come across as being as Turbulent as other Turbulent types. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that pronounced differences don\u2019t exist between Assertive Protagonists (ENFJ-A) and Turbulent Protagonists (ENFJ-T). These personalities still approach the world in the following different ways. Are you a Turbulent Protagonist? Check out \u201cTurbulent Protagonist Superpowers\u201d at the bottom of this article for the deepest insights into who you are. Sense of Self 81% of Assertive Protagonists say their self-confidence is high or very high, compared to 39% of Turbulent Protagonists. \u201cSELF-CONFIDENCE\u201d SURVEY As would be expected, Assertive Protagonists view themselves with more self-confidence, while Turbulent Protagonists tend to see themselves with less. However, as Protagonists are charismatic and natural leaders, this Turbulent tendency may not always be evident on the surface. This self-assessment can help keep Turbulent Protagonists humbler in their leadership. When Protagonists take their crusades and sense of righteousness too far, they can sometimes be overbearing. Turbulent Protagonists\u2019 humility may help them remain more immune to such excesses than their Assertive counterparts. The Turbulent lack of confidence might also heighten the oversensitivity that this personality type sometimes indulges in, while Assertive Protagonists may restrain to a higher degree their tendency to take things personally. If they discover that they aren\u2019t living up to their ideals, Assertive Protagonists may be able to hold their self-esteem more intact. This ability can be useful for moving an agenda forward instead of worrying about their capabilities. 55% of Assertive Protagonists describe their level of anxiety about their body image as minimal, compared to 24% of Turbulent Protagonists. \u201cBODY IMAGE\u201d SURVEY Ideally, how one looks is unimportant. Body image may seem superficial. But to a personality type like Protagonists, who are likely more \u201cpublic\u201d in some sense of the word, it can be impactful. As a reflection of Turbulent Protagonists\u2019 lesser confidence, they may act with even less certainty if they\u2019re not comfortable in their own skin. This greater self-consciousness may apply to many areas of their lives \u2013 but it may also help them relate to many other people with similar \u201cless than\u201d feelings. Assertive Protagonists may not be able to muster quite the same degree of empathy. Protagonist Differences in Emotions, Behaviors, and the People in Their Lives 74% of Turbulent Protagonists say they often \u2013 or very often \u2013 feel sad, compared to 37% of Assertive Protagonists. \u201cSADNESS\u201d SURVEY Broader emotions guide both Assertive and Turbulent Protagonists when they make decisions, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us how these personalities handle transient emotional states. Both types of Protagonists tend to adopt the problems of others as their own. Being prone to experiencing their emotions more often might increase this tendency in Turbulent Protagonists. Sharing others\u2019 emotions can increase Turbulent Protagonists\u2019 level of compassion. But, if taken too far, it can also weigh them down. 85% of Assertive Protagonists feel like they have control over their emotions, compared to 50% of Turbulent Protagonists. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY Their confidence may have Assertive Protagonists believing that they are unlikely to be hurt \u2013 or that if they were hurt, the pain would be manageable. This sense of greater invulnerability may create a protective shell around Assertive Protagonists\u2019 feelings, and such armor may allow them more detachment when needed. They likely deal with people more calmly. This more relaxed approach can be especially helpful in upsetting situations that can benefit from the presence of cooler heads. However, to avoid extremes, it\u2019s important to note that half of Turbulent Protagonists also feel like they have control over their emotions. Both personalities might readily possess this quality, but it\u2019s more likely to be found in Assertive Protagonists. 90% of Assertive Protagonists feel like they effectively manage the stress in their lives, compared to 45% of Turbulent Protagonists. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY The stressors that one type of Protagonist encounters are not necessarily more or less than the other one faces. The amount would depend on the nature of the individual Protagonist\u2019s life. However, Assertive Protagonists are about twice as likely to say they manage stress well. These personalities probably expect tension to be a part of life and view it as natural and something to enthusiastically overcome. They may even inspire others of all personality types to join them in a quest to claim victory over such difficulties. Turbulent Protagonists are apt to pair their somewhat more emotional nature with the demanding situations they face. Such reactions may dampen their attempt at handling stressful situations with a cool head. The combination may leave them feeling overwhelmed and out of control. These personalities are also more likely to show an understanding of those in similar plights. This empathy can bring them closer to those who need kindness rather than inspiration. 62% of Assertive Protagonists find it easy to make an important decision without consulting anyone first, compared to 33% of Turbulent Protagonists. \u201cRELYING ON OTHERS\u201d SURVEY Assertive Protagonists tend to act more independently than their Turbulent counterparts. Many feel they don\u2019t need the counsel of others when making important decisions. This allows them to do what they need to without the baggage that can come with including others in decision-making. That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re loners by any definition. They remain Extraverts bolstered by the Feeling personality trait, so there are likely plenty of people around. But Assertive Protagonists may often display their prominent independent streak. Thanks to their outgoing nature, most Turbulent Protagonists are more apt to seek the counsel of others in the decision-making process. They may not feel comfortable choosing an action without external input, due to their somewhat lower sense of confidence. Trusted advice can be reassuring \u2013 or it can talk Turbulent Protagonists out of making serious errors. Either way, there are likely to be more quality exchanges between these Protagonists and the people in their lives. Summary Assertive and Turbulent Protagonist personality differences include: Assertive Protagonists are more confident, allowing them to move boldly and independently, while Turbulent Protagonists can be more sensitive to the problems of others. Turbulent Protagonists are more likely than Assertive Protagonists to be self-conscious. Assertive Protagonists are more comfortable dealing with emotions and stress, while Turbulent Protagonists are less so. However, this can help Turbulent Protagonists empathize more deeply with others who are having trouble dealing with similar things. Assertive Protagonists are likely to be more independent and less inclined to seek the advice of others. Turbulent Protagonists are more likely to ask for an opinion and have more robust exchanges with the people in their lives. Altruism Can Be Expressed in Many Ways Assertive Protagonists are likely to be a pinch more objective and less influenced by emotions. But they still decide matters through a broader, more consistent emotional filter, as all Feeling personality types do. Turbulent Protagonists are likely to be a little more reactive and emotions-based. Identity is about shading shared traits with a different tint within the same fundamental hue. Both Assertive and Turbulent personalities remain kind and inspirational Protagonists \u2013 just in their distinctly different ways."}]}

With an enviable imagination and invigorating sense of spontaneity, Entrepreneurs are never boring. They love exploring interesting ideas, both in discussion and by going out and seeing for themselves, which means that Entrepreneurs always seem to have some fun activity hidden up their sleeves. At the same time, Entrepreneur personalities are easy-going, tolerant, and charming, making them naturally quite popular. A Zest for Life Hands-on, physical activities like team sports are Entrepreneurs\u2019 idea of fun, and these environments give them plenty of chances to make new friends. There is little difficulty for Entrepreneurs here \u2013 they seem to get along with just about everyone, and make new friends wherever they go. Entrepreneurs live in the moment, and as a naturally confident personality type (especially if they are Assertive as well), they don\u2019t worry much about what others think of them. This attracts friends who share their attitude and zest for life. While not opposed to long philosophical discussions, and often enjoying the intellectual exercise, Entrepreneurs are unlikely to develop friendships based solely around one-on-one discussions about European economic challenges and the role of religion in politics. Straightforward to the point of being blunt, Entrepreneurs call it like they see it, and an honest opinion in debate is a sure thing. But at their hearts, Entrepreneurs are people of action, preferring to do what can be done than to talk about what might someday be. Adventure Awaits Sitting idle, especially in boredom, is the bane of Entrepreneurs\u2019 existence. Exploration, excitement, adrenaline and risk \u2013 Entrepreneurs\u2019 friends should be prepared for all of these things. Often enough they\u2019re happy to perform for the crowd, but they also tend to encourage their friends to join in. Most personality types might take \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d personally, but Entrepreneurs are comfortable with who they are, and are more likely to just shrug their shoulders and move on with those friends who are game for adventure."}]}

People with this personality type strive for win-win situations, choosing teamwork over competition whenever possible. Reliable \u2013 Rather than working in sporadic, excited bursts that leave things half finished, Defenders are meticulous and careful. They take a steady approach, ensuring that things are done to the highest standard \u2013 and often going well beyond what is required. Observant \u2013 Defender personalities have a talent for noticing things, particularly about other people. They pay attention to the smallest details of what someone says and does, giving them unexpected insights into other people\u2019s lives and emotions. Enthusiastic \u2013 When the goal is right, Defenders apply all of their gifts to something that they believe will make a real, positive difference in people\u2019s lives \u2013 whether that\u2019s fighting poverty with a global initiative or simply making a customer\u2019s day. Hardworking \u2013 Defenders don\u2019t just get their work done \u2013 they take pride in it. People with this personality type often form an emotional attachment to the projects and organizations that they\u2019ve dedicated themselves to, and they won\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve done their share \u2013 or more than their share \u2013 to be of help. Good Practical Skills \u2013 This personality type offers the rare combination of an altruistic nature and hard-won practicality. Defenders don\u2019t just hope to help others. They take action \u2013 meaning that they\u2019re more than happy to roll up their sleeves and do what\u2019s necessary to care for their friends, family, and anyone else who needs it. Defender Weaknesses Overly Humble \u2013 Defenders are so concerned with other people\u2019s feelings that they may refuse to make their thoughts known or to take any duly earned credit for their contributions. And they often downplay their efforts entirely when they think that they could have done some minor aspect of a task better. Taking Things Personally \u2013 Although they might try to hide it, people with this personality type are deeply sensitive to others\u2019 opinions, and they can be thrown off-balance if someone doesn\u2019t appreciate, approve of, or agree with them. When they encounter criticism or disagreement \u2013 even if it\u2019s well intentioned \u2013 Defenders may feel as if they\u2019re experiencing a personal attack. Repressing Their Feelings \u2013 Private and reserved, Defenders tend to internalize their feelings, particularly negative ones. This can create misunderstandings in their relationships. Eventually, all of their repressed feelings and resentments may boil over in a sudden, uncharacteristic outburst of frustration. Overcommitted \u2013 Defenders\u2019 dutifulness can create situations where they are overwhelmed but unwilling to relax their standards or ask for help. As a result, Defender personalities may suffer silently, trying to do everything themselves, even when it\u2019s simply impossible. Reluctant to Change \u2013 Defenders are among the personality types that struggle the most with change. Breaking with tradition isn\u2019t easy for Defenders, who place great value on history and precedent. Even when change is necessary, they may wait until the situation reaches a breaking point before altering course. Too Altruistic \u2013 Defenders\u2019 giving, generous nature can leave them vulnerable to being taken advantage of by others. It can be hard for people with this personality type to rock the boat and stand up to someone who isn\u2019t pulling their own weight."}]}

People with this personality type can be counted on to see their promises and responsibilities through \u2013 even when it\u2019s difficult to do so. Passionate \u2013 Protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. These types brim with interests, and they take great pleasure in pursuing their hobbies \u2013 whether that\u2019s hiking, cooking, dancing, growing houseplants, or something else entirely. As a result, they rarely find themselves at a loss for something interesting to do. Altruistic \u2013 These personalities are known for harboring a deep desire to be a force for positive change. Protagonists genuinely believe that if they bring people together, they can do a world of good. Charismatic \u2013 Determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles. Whether they\u2019re captain of their softball team or a leader on the world stage, they rarely lose sight of their main goal: to be of service to others. Protagonist (ENFJ) Weaknesses Unrealistic \u2013 Many Protagonists put pressure on themselves to right every wrong that they encounter. But no matter how hard these personalities strive, it just isn\u2019t realistic for them to solve all of the world\u2019s problems. If they aren\u2019t careful, they can spread themselves too thin \u2013 and be left unable to help anyone. Overly Idealistic \u2013 Protagonists tend to have clear ideas about what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. They often think that everyone shares these fundamental principles \u2013 or, at least, that everyone should share these principles. So it can come as a genuine shock to Protagonists when people violate their core values, such as truth or justice. Condescending \u2013 People with this personality type enjoy teaching others, particularly about the causes and beliefs that matter so much to them. But, at times, Protagonists\u2019 attempts to \u201cenlighten\u201d others may come across as patronizing \u2013 not the most effective strategy for persuading other people, unfortunately. Intense \u2013 When it comes to self-improvement, Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination. But they may not recognize that not everyone shares these qualities. At times, Protagonists may push others to make changes that they aren\u2019t ready for \u2013 or simply aren\u2019t interested in making in the first place. Overly Empathetic \u2013 Compassion is among this personality type\u2019s greatest strengths. But Protagonists have a tendency to take on other people\u2019s problems as their own \u2013 a habit that can leave them emotionally and physically exhausted."}]}

A Campaigner (ENFP) is someone with the Extraverted , Intuitive , Feeling , and Prospecting personality traits. These people tend to embrace big ideas and actions that reflect their sense of hope and goodwill toward others. Their vibrant energy can flow in many directions. It doesn\u2019t interest me what you do for a living. I want to know what you ache for \u2013 and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart\u2019s longing. ORIAH MOUNTAIN DREAMER Campaigners (ENFPs) are true free spirits \u2013 outgoing, openhearted, and open-minded. With their lively, upbeat approach to life, they stand out in any crowd. But even though they can be the life of the party, Campaigners don\u2019t just care about having a good time. These personality types run deep \u2013 as does their longing for meaningful, emotional connections with other people. The Magic of Everyday Life Friendly and outgoing, Campaigners are devoted to enriching their relationships and their social lives. But beneath their sociable, easygoing exteriors, they have rich, vibrant inner lives as well. Without a healthy dose of imagination, creativity, and curiosity, a Campaigner simply wouldn\u2019t be a Campaigner. In their unique way, Campaigners can be quite introspective. They can\u2019t help but ponder the deeper meaning and significance of life \u2013 even when they should be paying attention to something else. These personalities believe that everything \u2013 and everyone \u2013 is connected, and they live for the glimmers of insight that they can gain into these connections. Campaigners are independent and creative, always on the lookout for the magic and meaning in everyday life. When something sparks their imagination, Campaigners can show an enthusiasm that is nothing short of infectious. These personalities radiate a positive energy that draws in other people, and Campaigners may find themselves being held up by their peers as a leader or guru. But once the initial bloom of inspiration wears off, Campaigners can struggle with self-discipline and consistency, losing steam on projects that once meant so much to them. Seeking Joy Campaigners are proof that seeking out life\u2019s joys and pleasures isn\u2019t the same as being shallow. Seemingly in the blink of an eye, people with this personality type can transform from impassioned idealists to carefree figures on the dance floor. Campaigner personalities are capable of intense thought and feeling \u2013 and also of kicking back and having a good time. Even in moments of fun, Campaigners want to connect emotionally with others. Few things matter more to these personality types than having genuine, heartfelt conversations with the people they cherish. Campaigners believe that everyone deserves to express their feelings, and their empathy and warmth create spaces where even the most timid spirits can feel comfortable opening up. People with this personality type need to be careful, however. Campaigners\u2019 intuition may lead them to read far too much into other people\u2019s actions and behaviors. Instead of simply asking for an explanation, Campaigners may end up puzzling over someone else\u2019s desires or intentions. This kind of social stress is what keeps harmony-focused Campaigners awake at night. Campaigners will spend a lot of time exploring different relationships, feelings, and ideas before they find a path for their lives that feels right. But when they finally do find their way, their imagination, empathy, and courage can light up not only their own lives but also the world around them."}]}

Button-down environments that revolve around tightly held traditions and strictly enforced procedures are unlikely to appeal to Adventurer personalities. Spontaneous, charming, and genuinely fun people to be around, Adventurers just want a chance to express those natural qualities, and to know that their efforts are appreciated. Adventurer Subordinates People with the Adventurer personality type don\u2019t like to be controlled, and this can be quite clear in subordinate positions \u2013 they loathe being micromanaged. At the same time, Adventurers aren\u2019t well-known for their long-term focus, but rather their adaptability and spontaneity. They\u2019ll use unconventional methods, sometimes risky ones, and existing rules are just someone else\u2019s way of doing things. Still, Adventurers find a way to make things happen. To manage Adventurer personalities successfully, there need to be clearly set goals, and otherwise an open sandbox. If this balance can be made to work, Adventurers show themselves to be eager learners and passionate problem-solvers, especially if they get to deal one-on-one with other people or to tackle a problem solo. People with this personality type are humble, even shy, and unlikely to put themselves on the spot by volunteering their help. But Adventurers do love to feel appreciated, and if assigned a task, they work hard to earn that appreciation. Adventurer Colleagues Among their peers Adventurers feel most comfortable. Working with equals and giving some advice in order to solve practical problems is right where Adventurer personalities like to be. While they may exhaust themselves if their role requires an excessive amount of social interaction, they are otherwise quite charming and have excellent networking skills. Adventurers are tolerant and friendly, and usually just do what needs to be done regardless of whether their colleagues pull their own weight. At the end of the day though, Adventurers are sensitive and need to know that these efforts are appreciated \u2013 a well-placed compliment goes a long way. Adventurers do let their personal goals affect their approach to their work, which can make them a little unpredictable, but this is balanced by their desire for harmony and willingness to find win-win solutions whenever possible. Adventurer Managers The position that feels most unnatural to Adventurers is management. They are not a domineering personality type, and take no joy in exerting control over others, planning long-term goals, or disciplining unsatisfactory behavior. But just because it feels a little strange, doesn\u2019t mean Adventurer personalities aren\u2019t good at it. Adventurers\u2019 sensitivity allows them to be great listeners, helping them to align their subordinates\u2019 personal motivations with the task at hand. They also give their subordinates the freedom to do what needs to be done to solve what needs to be solved on any given day, and Adventurers are likely to dig into that work right alongside them. This gives Adventurer managers a marked style of inspiration and cooperation, and they\u2019re usually well-liked."}]}

These personalities can actually feel another person\u2019s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of this sensitivity, Mediators tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally. Generous \u2013 Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at other people\u2019s expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where it\u2019s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no one\u2019s needs go unmet. Open-Minded \u2013 Tolerant and accepting, Mediators try not to judge anyone else\u2019s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to fault-finding, and many Mediators feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because they\u2019re so accepting, Mediators often become confidants for their friends and loved ones \u2013 and occasionally for total strangers. Creative \u2013 Mediators love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their minds to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits \u2013 or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists. Passionate \u2013 When an idea or movement captures their imagination, Mediators want to give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesn\u2019t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions. Idealistic \u2013 Mediators strive to follow their conscience, even when doing the right thing isn\u2019t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life \u2013 one that helps others and leaves the world a better place. Mediator (INFP) Weaknesses Unrealistic \u2013 Nothing in this world is perfect \u2013 and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams. Self-Isolating \u2013 Mediators long to connect with others, but they don\u2019t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated. Unfocused \u2013 Mediators\u2019 imaginative, introspective nature doesn\u2019t always lend itself to productivity. Many Mediators get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn\u2019t that they are incapable \u2013 rather, it\u2019s that they run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action. Emotionally Vulnerable \u2013 The emotional attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless Mediators establish boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people\u2019s negative moods or attitudes. Desperate to Please \u2013 Conflict tends to be stressful for Mediators, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change that person\u2019s mind. Unfortunately, Mediators\u2019 desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs. Self-Critical \u2013 Mediators believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. When Mediators fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage Mediators, leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams. Feeling self-critical right now? Before going to the next section, scroll up to reread your strengths \u2013 and let them serve as a reminder of how much you, dear Mediator, can bring to this world."}]}

People with this personality type crave alone time, but they\u2019re also vulnerable to loneliness. They long to feel accepted and well-liked, but they hate the idea of pretending to be anyone but their authentic selves. And while they hesitate to draw attention to themselves, they don\u2019t want to be invisible, either. The good news is that, in the company of true friends, Mediators can escape the hamster wheel of these insecurities and focus on what really matters. For these personalities, friendship is a precious commodity \u2013 an opportunity for two people to lift each other up and change each other\u2019s lives for the better. Mediators truly believe in the old saying that \u201ca friend in need is a friend indeed.\u201d Few things bolster their sense of purpose like being there for someone they care about. Perhaps because of their intense investment in these relationships, Mediators tend to feel most fulfilled by spending time with a small, intimate circle of friends. Acquaintances may come and go, but this inner circle is likely to include Mediators\u2019 friends for life. Searching for a Kindred Spirit Although Mediators are warm and accepting, they don\u2019t always find it easy to make friends. This may be because superficial, casual relationships can leave these personalities feeling a bit empty. Mediators are looking for lasting, authentic friendships with people who share their desire to think and feel deeply, to do the right thing, and to give more to the world than they take from it. Among kindred spirits, people with this personality type feel accepted and understood, happy to be themselves and bloom in their own time. That said, Mediators are capable of befriending all sorts of people. The combination of their Intuitive and Prospecting personality traits draws them to diverse perspectives, which helps them appreciate friends whose experiences and worldviews are totally different from their own. Mediators may actually find it invigorating to connect with someone who, on the surface, has little in common with them. For Mediators, a true friendship is founded on shared values, not just shared experiences. People with this personality type are unlikely to form strong friendships simply out of convenience. For example, while their affection for their coworkers may be strong, just working in the same office or shop isn\u2019t enough for Mediators to guarantee a substantial friendship. Deeper connections must come into play. Friends for Life When Mediators befriend someone, they may secretly (or not so secretly) hope to stay close with that person for life. These personalities are capable of strong, stable relationships marked by passionate support, subtle poetic wit, and a profound level of emotional insight. Long-standing friendships tend to draw out less obvious aspects of the Mediator personality type, including a fierce protective streak. Many Mediators find that they can stand up for their friends in ways that they\u2019d struggle to manage for themselves. Although Mediators value their friendships, they also need personal space and alone time in order to recharge. At times, people with this personality type may withdraw from even their closest friends in order to reconnect with themselves and restore their energy, as all Introverts must. These departures are usually temporary, but Mediators may need to make sure that their friends don\u2019t feel snubbed by their absence. Even as their friendships grow stronger, Mediators\u2019 enigmatic qualities never truly vanish. Mediators look for ways to improve their friendships and share their affection with those who matter to them. Often, this takes the form of spending quality time with their friends \u2013 coming up with grand visions for the future and sharing their secret dreams and ideas with someone they know they can trust. But even when Mediators are entirely on their own, they always hold their friends in their hearts."}]}

This is a personality type known for having a vibrant, vivid imagination, but few Advocates can imagine themselves settling for a match founded on anything less than true love. It can take time for Advocates to find a compatible partner. Some people might think that Advocates are too choosy, and it\u2019s true that these personalities can be prone to unrealistic expectations. With their perfectionistic, idealistic nature, Advocates might be tempted to hold out for a \u201cperfect\u201d partner or relationship that ultimately doesn\u2019t exist. The good news? Advocates\u2019 idealism \u2013 if balanced with just enough realism \u2013 can actually enhance their love life. Is This for Real? Advocates tend to be attuned to their core values, keenly aware of what matters to them on a soul level. This helps them look beyond surface-level attraction and understand whether they\u2019re compatible with someone on a deeper, more meaningful level. These insights are essential for helping Advocates avoid matches that aren\u2019t founded on authenticity or shared principles. Advocates care about integrity, and they tend to bristle when people try to change them or talk them into something that they don\u2019t believe. As a result, Advocate personalities gravitate toward partners who appreciate them as they are. As romantic partners, Advocates are warm, caring, honest, and insightful \u2013 and they patiently work to uncover their loved one\u2019s innermost needs and desires. Once Advocates do find a suitable relationship, they rarely take it for granted. Instead, they tend to look for ways to grow as individuals and strengthen their connection with their partner. This can help Advocates\u2019 relationships reach a level of depth and sincerity of which many people can only dream. The Power of Love People with this personality type create a depth to their relationships that can hardly be described in conventional terms. Because of their sensitivity and insight, Advocates can make their partners feel heard and understood in beautiful ways. Advocates aren\u2019t afraid to express their love, and they feel it with all their hearts. One of the things that Advocates find most important is establishing genuine, deep connections with the people they care about. Advocates tend to recognize that love isn\u2019t a passive emotion but rather an opportunity to grow and learn, and they expect their partners to share this mindset. As a result, relationships with these personalities are not for the uncommitted or the shallow. Advocates are intensely passionate in ways that transcend the present moment, and what truly fulfills them is the way that a loving, meaningful relationship evolves and deepens over time. In their heart of hearts, people with the Advocate personality type crave an emotional and even spiritual connection with their partner. They cherish not just the act of being in a relationship but also what it means to become one with another person in mind, body, and soul."}]}

For these personalities, parenting often requires mastering new skills and developing cognitive flexibility. Fortunately, Architects are pretty much always up for a challenge \u2013 and for Architects who have children, parenthood can be an especially meaningful challenge to take on. An Honest Connection Architects want their children to grow up to be capable and self-reliant, with clear interests and strong critical-thinking skills. Rather than enforcing pointless rules, parents with this personality type look for age-appropriate ways to foster their children\u2019s independence. That\u2019s not to say that Architects are lenient \u2013 far from it. They expect their children to use their freedom responsibly. Architect parents treat their children the way they want to be treated themselves \u2013 with candor and respect. Some personality types might shelter their children from difficult subjects, but Architect parents believe that knowledge is far better than ignorance. For them, candor is a way of showing respect, and shielding their children from reality would be a disservice. Of course, the success of this approach depends on Architects\u2019 ability to correctly gauge their children\u2019s readiness for these hard truths. The Chaos of Emotions Compared to many other personality types, Architects aren\u2019t especially comfortable with displays of affection. Showering someone with love and praise can feel unnatural to them \u2013 even if that \u201csomeone\u201d is their own child. But children need cuddling and approval and other expressions of love, particularly during their younger years. As a result, Architect parents may need to expand their emotional comfort zone in order to show their children just how much they are loved. Another challenge for parents with this personality type is offering emotional support. Architects take pride in being in command of their feelings, and they might (consciously or unconsciously) expect their children to be able to do the same. But this expectation isn\u2019t reasonable \u2013 emotions may be confusing and, at times, chaotic, but they\u2019re perfectly normal, and children need validation and support in order to navigate them. Architects are at their best when they can develop a plan to solve a problem\u2019s root cause. But sometimes the best solution to a kid\u2019s problem is just sitting with them as they explore their feelings. Preparing for Life\u2019s Challenges Architects try to make sure that their children are prepared to deal with anything that life throws at them. Parents with this personality type have a talent for reframing challenges as learning opportunities \u2013 and in doing so, they can inspire their children to develop their own style of rational thinking and problem-solving. Over time, Architects\u2019 children can apply these skills to increasingly complex situations, building their confidence as they grow. Every parent has a different dream for their child\u2019s future. For Architects, the dream is to raise a competent adult who knows their own mind and solves their own problems. Architects understand that this can\u2019t happen if they protect their children from every difficult or unpleasant thing in life. But their hope is that, if they give their children the right tools, they won\u2019t have to."}]}

A Defender (ISFJ) is someone with the Introverted , Observant , Feeling , and Judging personality traits. These people tend to be warm and unassuming in their own steady way. They\u2019re efficient and responsible, giving careful attention to practical details in their daily lives. Love only grows by sharing. You can only have more for yourself by giving it away to others. Brian Tracy In their unassuming, understated way, Defenders help make the world go round. Hardworking and devoted, people with this personality type feel a deep sense of responsibility to those around them. Defenders can be counted on to meet deadlines, remember birthdays and special occasions, uphold traditions, and shower their loved ones with gestures of care and support. But they rarely demand recognition for all that they do, preferring instead to operate behind the scenes. This is a capable, can-do personality type, with a wealth of versatile gifts. Though sensitive and caring, Defenders also have excellent analytical abilities and an eye for detail. And despite their reserve, they tend to have well-developed people skills and robust social relationships. Defenders are truly more than the sum of their parts, and their varied strengths shine in even the most ordinary aspects of their daily lives. Defenders are true altruists, meeting kindness with kindness-in-excess and engaging with the work and people they believe in with enthusiasm and generosity. The Gift of Loyalty Among Defenders\u2019 most distinctive traits is loyalty. Rare is the Defender who allows a friendship or relationship to fade away from lack of effort. Instead, they invest a great deal of energy into maintaining strong connections with their loved ones \u2013 and not just by sending \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d texts. People with this personality type are known for dropping everything and lending a hand whenever a friend or family member is going through a hard time. Defenders tend to feel most energized and effective when they\u2019re showing up for someone who needs their help. Defenders\u2019 sense of loyalty doesn\u2019t stop with their nearest and dearest \u2013 it often extends to their communities, their employers, and even family traditions. But the intensity of their commitment and desire to serve can have its downsides. Other people may take advantage of Defenders\u2019 helpful, hardworking nature, leaving them feeling burned out and overworked. And Defenders may feel guilty or stressed when they contemplate changes \u2013 even necessary changes \u2013 to themselves, their relationships, or the way they\u2019ve done things in the past. The Highest of Standards For Defenders, \u201cgood enough\u201d is rarely good enough. People with this personality type can be meticulous to the point of perfectionism. They take their responsibilities personally, consistently going above and beyond and doing everything that they can to exceed others\u2019 expectations. Defender personalities are known for their humility, and they rarely seek the spotlight. But what happens when Defenders\u2019 efforts go unnoticed or unappreciated? While Defenders tend to underplay their accomplishments, that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t enjoy recognition \u2013 or that they\u2019re fine with being taken for granted. Unless they learn to stand up for themselves, Defenders may find themselves quietly losing their enthusiasm and motivation, eventually becoming resentful toward the people who just don\u2019t seem to appreciate them. Showing Up for Others \u2013 and Themselves Although they\u2019re Introverted, Defenders have a deeply social nature. Thanks to their ability to remember the details of other people\u2019s lives, Defenders have a special talent for making their friends and acquaintances feel seen, known, and cherished. Few personality types can match Defenders\u2019 ability to choose just the right gift for any occasion, whether large or small. Dedicated and thoughtful, Defenders find great joy in helping those around them build stable, secure, and happy lives. It may not be easy for people with this personality type to show up for themselves in the way that they show up for other people, but when they do, they often find themselves with even more energy and motivation to do good in the world."}]}

It\u2019s no surprise, then, that they are anything but apathetic about friendship. Protagonists put sincere, dedicated effort into staying close with their friends. For these personalities, friendships are far from expendable or insignificant \u2013 instead, they\u2019re a key component of a life well lived. A Wealth of Perspectives Few personality types can match Protagonists\u2019 sincere desire to get to know people. For Protagonists, discovering someone\u2019s quirks and opinions and hopes and follies is one of life\u2019s purest pleasures. Most Protagonists can\u2019t help but be fascinated by other worldviews, even those with which they wholeheartedly disagree. Encountering a wealth of perspectives is what keeps life interesting for these types. Protagonists surround themselves with all sorts of friends and acquaintances, including those whose experiences and ideas differ wildly from their own. That said, most Protagonists find it difficult to respect anyone who takes shortcuts, disrespects others, or refuses to challenge the status quo. Instead, they find it easiest to connect with people who share their core ideals, particularly their commitment to doing the right thing and leaving the world better than they found it. It is with these closest friends that Protagonists truly open up, sharing their vulnerabilities and their most precious dreams for their lives. These personalities maintain warm, caring, and supportive connections with many people, but they tend to show their full selves \u2013 including their insecurities \u2013 only to an inner circle of friends who have earned their trust. Through Thick and Thin Protagonists can be among the best friends anyone could wish for. Kindhearted and trustworthy, people with this personality type dedicate incredible amounts of energy and attention to their friendships. They want their friends to feel not merely validated but supported, not merely heard but understood. From their closest friends to their wide circle of acquaintances, Protagonist personalities approach relationships with a sense of purpose, creating bonds that are not easily broken. They can also be trusted to show up in ways both large and small \u2013 whether by taking time after a grueling day at work to help a friend spruce up their resume or by putting together a weekend-long destination birthday party for a friend who needs a boost. Nothing makes Protagonists happier than seeing the people they care about doing well, and few things could stop them from trying to help make that happen. Finding Balance While Protagonists enjoy lending a helping hand, they aren\u2019t always happy with the results. The truth is that some people don\u2019t have the energy or the drive to take full advantage of Protagonists\u2019 offers of help \u2013 or they simply might not want to. For example, their friend might ignore that resume advice, or they might decide to kick back and relax instead of using that new resume to send out job applications. When this happens, people with the Protagonist personality type may feel unappreciated, frustrated, or resentful. They may even become judgmental in an effort to push their friend forward \u2013 an approach that all too often backfires. As they mature, many Protagonists learn to avoid taking their friends\u2019 behavior personally. Paradoxically, having a more flexible attitude can guide these types to support the people they care about even more effectively. As many Protagonists discover, the most enduring friendships are based not only on mutual growth but also on acceptance, compassion, and genuine respect."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ESFP's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Entertainers are a typically charming, social personality type. They have an eye for beauty and are often touched deeply by it. They bring a lot of energy with them wherever they go. And members of this personality type remain the same, even when we split Assertive Entertainers (ESFP-A) and Turbulent Entertainers (ESFP-T) into separate Identities . But, as much as both remain Entertainers, important differences are brought about by the distinct way each Identity sees the world and themselves. Let\u2019s explore some ways our research shows these differences. The Inner Identity Differences of Assertive and Turbulent Entertainers 88% of Assertive Entertainers say they feel comfortable with themselves, compared to 65% of Turbulent Entertainers. \u201cOPTIMIST OR PESSIMIST\u201d SURVEY Entertainers tend to feel upbeat about who they are. The majority of both types of Entertainers responded positively when asked if they felt comfortable with themselves. Typically, these personalities would rather be anything but boring, and that may require a level of self-acceptance and internal comfort that allows their playfulness to thrive. Assertive and Turbulent Entertainers have this in common. However, the two types of Entertainers do not see their comfort levels identically. We find that more Assertive Entertainers say they are comfortable with themselves, as Assertive personality types usually do. And, as might be expected, fewer Turbulent Entertainers indicate that they feel at ease with themselves. But there are advantages to not being too comfortable. Turbulent Entertainers\u2019 somewhat lower comfort level may foster more of a need for self-improvement. This greater need can drive them toward a higher level of excellence. 51% of Turbulent Entertainers feel that reducing stress is very important, compared to 7% of Assertive Entertainers. \u201cISSUES AND CHALLENGES\u201d SURVEY Assertive Entertainers typically feel confident about handling what life throws at them and are unlikely to worry much about stress: either how to prevent it or how to reduce it. That doesn\u2019t mean that these personalities are oblivious to problems. It means that they don\u2019t allow problems to be as central a focus. They likely see most potential stressors as not being worth worrying about, nor worth their attention. This helps them maintain a relaxed and less reactive attitude. Such a calm response can be valuable when dealing with great pressure. But Turbulent Entertainers do tend to worry about difficult pressures in their lives. They may doubt their ability to handle an onslaught of difficulties and can feel overwhelmed. One of the best ways to reduce or prevent stress is to attempt to head off stressors before they intensify and become greater problems. For Turbulent Entertainers, this may take the form of being aware of any complications and sounding the alarm. Sharing their worries with others can alert those who may not notice the impending trouble themselves. 80% of Turbulent Entertainers say they are often afraid of making decisions, compared to 23% of Assertive Entertainers. \u201cNEED FOR CONTROL\u201d SURVEY Decision-making can also be a challenge for Turbulent Entertainers. Entertainers tend to be unfocused anyway, and this is especially true with long-term goals. Add the self-doubt and uncertainty that\u2019s a part of being Turbulent, and Turbulent Entertainers are even more hesitant to make decisions than most other Turbulent types. They are the second-highest of all personality types to admit to a fear of choosing. Indecisiveness can keep Turbulent Entertainers from moving forward quickly enough. They may find procrastination a problem, thinking it\u2019s better to make no decision than to make a bad one. But, on the plus side, Turbulent Entertainers aren\u2019t likely to decide things too lightly. They can be trusted to take things seriously. Assertive Entertainers may decide with little fear. But their bolder approach might affect the quality of those decisions if they make them too swiftly. Assertive Entertainers\u2019 confidence can stifle their need to question their conclusions. Sometimes, asking the right questions about their choices might be helpful \u2013 or even necessary. However, should a decision be urgent and require a quick response, Assertive Entertainers will likely shine. Some Outer Identity Differences between Assertive and Turbulent Entertainers 87% of Assertive Entertainers feel they have control over their emotions, compared to 40% of Turbulent Entertainers. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY Emotions are generally the coin of the realm for this personality type. Both Assertive and Turbulent Entertainers say they are eloquent when discussing their feelings, and they are among those least likely to say they\u2019re confused by the emotions of others. While they both say they are in touch with their emotions, that isn\u2019t the same as control. There, the two types of Entertainers differ. Control of emotions may feel like a matter of competency to Assertive Entertainers, and their confidence usually carries the day with matters of proficiency. From Assertive Entertainers\u2019 perspective, their reality is that they are relatively sure they can handle their emotions. Handling something competently is basically one of the definitions of control. The perspective is different for Turbulent Entertainers. Controlling emotions may feel like a matter of competency for these personalities too. However, with their often-present self-doubt, they are less likely to see themselves successfully controlling their feelings. Their uncertainty about themselves can color how they believe they will behave, and it may color how they see the past, giving them an overall impression that they have trouble regulating their emotions. This view might also create a self-fulfilling prophecy. If they believe they\u2019re not good with their feelings, they may act as though it\u2019s true. 68% of Turbulent Entertainers say they respond to their anger outwardly with actions and words, compared to 38% of Assertive Entertainers. \u201cANGER MANAGEMENT\u201d SURVEY This outward expression of anger can be a mark of greater honesty in Turbulent Entertainers. But being both conflict-averse and emotionally more expressive can spell trouble for these personalities. Getting angry at someone can easily ignite an argument \u2013 and fights often result from expressions of anger. Should this conflict play out, Turbulent Entertainers might feel guilty about expressing their feelings or for being \u201ctoo honest.\u201d While keeping their anger in can prevent Assertive Entertainers from making waves, it may also render them less transparent to the other people in their lives. This more optimistic, Assertive personality type might feel free to express their positive emotions but be more reluctant to express negative emotions. The air might never be entirely clear of hostile feelings. Sometimes anger fuels action, or it is necessary to get someone\u2019s attention. Concealing negative feelings could block Assertive Entertainers from experiencing their many benefits. 84% of Assertive Entertainers say they offer forgiveness to others faster than most people, compared to 48% of Turbulent Entertainers. \u201cFORGIVENESS\u201d SURVEY After the anger or other unpleasant emotions can come forgiveness. This personality type scores highest on always looking on the bright side of things. And both Assertive and Turbulent Entertainers are the types most likely to say they have faith in people. These attitudes may influence their tendency to forgive. They may try to find the good in everybody and every situation \u2013 even those that have caused pain. However, while both Entertainer personality types are sensitive, feelings are even more prominent in Turbulent Entertainers\u2019 lives. Relatively speaking, they are likely more easily hurt and may hold a grudge longer than Assertive Entertainers. Since the opinions or actions of others are less important to Assertive Entertainers, they are less likely to hold on to any slight they experience. Summary While the majority of both Assertive and Turbulent Entertainers say they are comfortable with themselves, Assertive Entertainers are more likely to do so. Stress is less of an issue for Assertive Entertainers. While difficult matters may hold the attention of Turbulent Entertainers longer, it can also help them remain more aware, allowing them to perhaps alert or remind others of problems. Turbulent Entertainers tend to say they feel and express difficult emotions more than Assertive Entertainers. This tendency may create a conflict between their social natures and the need to express negative emotions \u2013 the two may not always be compatible. While both Entertainer personality types are generally in touch with their emotions, Turbulent Entertainers may be more easily hurt by other people. This may prevent them from forgiving others as quickly as Assertive Entertainers. Always On \u2013 Only in Different Ways The gregarious Entertainer personality type is always bringing excitement and enthusiasm wherever they go and whatever they do. It doesn\u2019t matter if they are Turbulent or Assertive. But that doesn\u2019t mean that there are no differences between the two. Knowing those differences can be useful in bringing more balance into the lives of each Identity type. It can also help those who wish to better understand the Entertainers in their lives."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ENTJ's Assertive vs. Turbulent"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Commander personality types generally think and act big. But their Identity personality traits can make a difference in how they express themselves and how they react to life, other people, and the world around them. For all their distinct and vivid common characteristics, Assertive Commanders (ENTJ-A) and Turbulent Commanders (ENTJ-T) can have some deep differences from each other. Let\u2019s examine how being Assertive or Turbulent affects these notably driven and expressive people. Internal Effects While both personality types tend to forge ahead willfully in life, one of the biggest differences between Assertive and Turbulent Commanders is how they respond inside to routine stress. Assertive Commanders are much more likely to keep their stress under control. They have an easier time moving forward in a resolute Commander way, despite the feelings and thoughts that stress brings. 93% of Assertive Commanders agree that they effectively manage the stress in their life, versus 47% of Turbulent Commanders. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY It\u2019s much more difficult for Turbulent Commanders to prevent even moderately stressful events from affecting them. However, Commanders, in general, see themselves as being on top of things and likely to rise to meet life\u2019s challenges. So, while Turbulent members of this personality type may experience stress more acutely, it doesn\u2019t necessarily derail their momentum in life. It may alter their approach somewhat, though, when stress leads to negative perceptions. Turbulent Commanders are more likely to feel pessimistic following a setback, and this can affect their decision-making process. Notably, they\u2019re more likely than their Assertive counterparts to take steps to avoid stress or seek a pause to gather themselves. By contrast, Assertive Commanders are more likely to feel that stress helps them focus or even perform better. Both variants of this personality type can be aggressive and energetic. But in the case of Assertive individuals, stress is more likely to feed their motivation \u2013 and perhaps even increase their energy. 68% of Assertive Commanders say they perform tasks better when under stress than when they are calm, compared to 50% of Turbulent Commanders. \u201cHANDLING STRESS\u201d SURVEY When it comes to broader emotions, Assertive Commanders likely have an easier time mastering their state of mind as well. The Identity characteristics that make them less vulnerable to the effects of stress can also decrease the influence of negative emotions. This is significant because Commanders tend to prize their sense of dispassionate and decisive rationality. The Assertive trait can support this personality type\u2019s clarity of thought. 62% of Turbulent Commanders agree that negative emotions affect their ability to think clearly to a large degree, versus 38% of Assertive Commanders. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY Emotional control is important to most Commanders \u2013 they value it in themselves and respect it in others. But the way that Identity affects how these personality types are influenced by emotion isn\u2019t just about sensitivity to negative effects or feelings. It can also play a part in how strongly, freely, and readily Commanders experience and express a wide range of emotions. For example, compared to their Assertive counterparts, Turbulent Commanders are relatively open to \u201csofter\u201d or more positive feelings as well. 70% of Turbulent Commanders say they keep many things in their room that hold special sentimental value for them, compared to 45% of Assertive Commanders. \u201cHEAD VS. HEART\u201d SURVEY But while Assertive Commanders may be less likely to connect with inner sentiments, they\u2019re also less likely to delve into darker feelings. This benefits their self-esteem. Not only is their emotional state more stable, but it\u2019s usually more self-forgiving. Assertive Commanders are far more likely to report that they rarely feel ashamed of themselves. Overall, neither variant of this personality type is known for avoiding conflict or difficulty. But it\u2019s notable that Assertive Commanders tend to have an easier time letting go of agitated thoughts or feelings that may arise from such situations. These personalities are far less likely to report that they lie awake at night thinking about the things that upset them during the day. By contrast, Turbulent Commanders often struggle to move on or relax once they have become upset. External Effects One of the reasons Assertive Commanders seem to have an easier time letting go might be that they aren\u2019t as easily upset in the first place. They have the same capacity to become upset, but it\u2019s not as likely to occur as it is for Turbulent Commanders. An Assertive Identity offers Commanders a somewhat greater \u2013 though far from absolute \u2013 immunity to negative reactions to their experiences with people. They are far less likely than Turbulent Commanders to report being easily upset by other people. 91% of Assertive Commanders feel like they have control over their emotions, versus 59% of Turbulent Commanders. \u201cEMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE\u201d SURVEY But Turbulent Commanders\u2019 more sensitive reactions can also have positive implications. When (or if) Commanders themselves are the source of conflict or offense, it\u2019s the Turbulent personalities that are more likely to be bothered by their actions. Commanders can be brusque, but Turbulent Commanders are much more likely to report that they feel anxious if they know they\u2019ve upset someone. Accordingly, they may likewise demonstrate more concern. Assertive Commanders are less likely to feel bad if they\u2019ve hurt someone and, consequently, aren\u2019t as likely to take care to avoid doing so. 54% of Turbulent Commanders say they pick up most of their social cues from either the environment they\u2019re in or other people they \u2019re with, compared to 24% of Assertive Commanders. \u201cMANNERS\u201d SURVEY Even in dynamic, focused personality types like Commanders, the Turbulent trait is usually associated with greater emotional volatility. This can affect their conscious output just as much as their reactions, but not always negatively. It can apply to positive interactions as well. For example, Turbulent Commanders are more likely to report that they enjoy openly showing affection for people they care about. Commanders also externally express their Identity differences in ways beyond the social realm. One of the most notable contrasts between the variants is their sense \u2013 and demonstration \u2013 of confidence. Assertive Commanders are broadly possessed of greater confidence, both innately and in response to external events. 92% of Assertive Commanders rate their overall level of self-confidence as high or very high, compared to 51% of Turbulent Commanders. \u201cSELF-CONFIDENCE\u201d SURVEY This difference in confidence can have far-reaching effects in life, influencing how quickly Commanders recover from unwanted outcomes and how optimistic they are. Both personality variants tend to be bold, but Turbulent Commanders are more prone to worry and less likely to maintain their motivation in the face of difficulty. 87% of Assertive Commanders say their motivation is more likely to increase when something proves more difficult than they thought it would be, compared to 56% of Turbulent Commanders. \u201cGIVING UP AND LETTING GO\u201d SURVEY One manifestation of confidence is the way Commander personalities view themselves physically. Assertive Commanders are less likely to be anxious about their body image and somewhat more likely to consider themselves attractive. Moreover, their opinion of the way they look is less likely to change often. 78% of Assertive Commanders agree that they\u2019re generally happy with the way they look, versus 45% of Turbulent Commanders. \u201cBODY IMAGE\u201d SURVEY This echoes the general theme of stability versus volatility that is seen between the two Identities, as well as relating to the specific subject of confidence in the way they look. Summary Turbulent Commanders are less likely to manage their stress effectively and tend to have a hard time letting go of things that upset them. Assertive Commanders are more likely to feel that stress helps them focus and perform. Negative emotions are more likely to affect Turbulent Commanders\u2019 ability to think clearly. Assertive Commanders are less likely to feel ashamed or maintain a negative self-image. Turbulent Commanders are more likely to be easily upset by others and to be anxious if they upset someone else. Assertive Commanders have an easier time than their Turbulent counterparts feeling self-confident and maintaining their motivation in the face of difficulty. Turbulent Commanders are more likely to enjoy openly showing affection for those they care about, as well as sentimentality in general. Conclusions There are many unique ways that this powerful personality type displays the differences between Assertive and Turbulent Identity. It\u2019s important to note that each Identity is associated with specific challenges and advantages in certain situations, but neither personality trait automatically has greater benefits. Given this, learning to leverage the best of their traits while also balancing their extremity helps Commanders lead happy and successful lives."}]}

Laid back and spontaneous, people with the Adventurer personality type won\u2019t bog things down with arguments or structured long-term plans. Intellectually exhausting pastimes like debates over European economic policy won\u2019t hold their attention long. The here-and-now is what\u2019s important to Adventurers, and they love spending time with their friends doing casual, fun activities. Enjoying Life Together Adventurer personalities believe in actions, not words. They talk about what is, not what could, should or will be, and then they actually do it. This passion for action is a blessing for Adventurers, since it helps them get past their shyness in meeting new people. Adventurers are sensitive, much more so than most, and it takes time to build enough trust with new friends to open up and feel natural. If new acquaintances start things out by explaining \u201cYou\u2019d do way better if...\u201d, it\u2019s unlikely they will ever be close \u2013 Adventurers just take these remarks too personally for comfort. People with this personality type are happy to get along with just about anyone, but potential friends need to ease up on being too judgmental or demanding. If their friends keep things supportive and easy-going, Adventurers are happy to return the favor with added warmth and laughter. When they\u2019re with friends they trust, Adventurers know how to relax, shedding rules, traditions and expectations in favor of just enjoying themselves. Those who prefer safe, structured environments might end up struggling in these friendships though, especially if they lecture Adventurers on how they\u2019re living their lives. As with any criticism, those friends are free to do their own thing, and to leave Adventurers to do theirs. Adventurers\u2019 relaxed, non-judgmental attitudes make it easy for them to get along with others, but it\u2019s not always the same way around. Lots of personal space and freedom are essential to Adventurer personalities, and it\u2019s often other Explorer types, who share their \u201clive and let live\u201d worldview and joy in actually doing things, that gravitate towards Adventurers. There\u2019s really no better friend than Adventurers for dropping the pretenses and enjoying low-stress fun."}]}

Loyal and warm, Consuls are known for standing by their friends no matter what, and providing a constant source of emotional support and encouragement. Consul personalities are also sensitive to the traditions of friendship, seeing the support they offer as much as a responsibility as a pleasure. Doing everything they can to make sure their friends are happy, and being so comfortable with introductions and small talk, Consuls are naturally very popular in pretty much any environment. This is a dynamic that Consuls genuinely enjoy, but they also expect their efforts and support to be reciprocated. There\u2019s nothing quite as hurtful to people with the Consul personality type as finding out that a trusted friend is critical of their beliefs or habits, except maybe being told so in a direct confrontation. Consuls have a tendency to believe that their friends can do no wrong, always stepping up to defend them regardless of circumstances, and they expect the same benefit of the doubt in return. Consuls can greatly expand their circle of friends if they learn to be more receptive to other perspectives, rather than making snap judgments and conclusions. It\u2019s important for Consuls, as with anyone, to avoid being insulated from other viewpoints and opinions, to relate to and understand ever more people. We\u2019re All in This Together On the other hand, Consuls are great at using their sensitivity to stay in tune with what motivates and drives their friends. While in their weaker moments, Consul personalities can sometimes use these observations to manipulate others, they are far more interested in maintaining strong relationships, and this is a great tool for doing so. Altruists that they are, Consuls almost always use their powers for good, encouraging and inspiring others. By and large, the Consul personality type is a pleasant and sincere one. Their energy and social intelligence win them many acquaintances and friends, and their support and dedication keep those friendships close and strong. With so much zest for life and company, dull moments are sure to be few and far between."}]}

Boisterous and spontaneous, fun-loving and maybe a little crass, people with the Entrepreneur personality type love tackling problems as they arise and telling great stories about their solutions afterwards. Naturally, some positions work better with these qualities than others, but Entrepreneurs are adaptable individuals, and can find a way to make just about any situation a little more interesting. Entrepreneur Subordinates Entrepreneurs\u2019 most challenging position is the one that most people have to start out in: as subordinates. While perfectly capable of exercising restraint on their own terms, Entrepreneur personalities hate having others\u2019 rules and regulations foisted upon them. Entrepreneurs are known for their experimentation, improvisation and quick thinking \u2013 if they\u2019re not allowed to use these qualities and have to check in with a supervisor for every little thing, they\u2019ll be bored and frustrated. Entrepreneurs know well that risk equals reward, and they\u2019ll gladly skirt more mundane tasks in favor of something a little more exciting, in the hope that it catches someone\u2019s attention. A plaque and a bonus go a long way for people with this personality type. Getting ahead by the tenets of staid reliability, quiet helpfulness, or mere seniority isn\u2019t Entrepreneurs\u2019 way \u2013 they move forward by sheer force of personality in a well-handled crisis. Entrepreneur Colleagues As colleagues, Entrepreneurs have a work hard, play hard mentality \u2013 as long as everyone else is pulling their weight, they\u2019ll gladly pull their own, and have a great time doing it. Charming and popular individuals that they are, networking comes naturally to Entrepreneurs. These qualities make it easy for Entrepreneur personalities to get along with just about anyone. At the same time, if Entrepreneurs see a colleague as incompetent, or worse, lazy, they let them know in no uncertain terms. Emotional sensitivity is not their strong suit. Entrepreneurs are very observant and well-tuned to changes in their colleagues\u2019 habits and moods \u2013 unless they themselves are the cause of distress. Entrepreneur Managers Management positions are where Entrepreneurs are usually most comfortable, as they often give the most flexibility. Rules and traditions are a bother for people with the Entrepreneur personality type \u2013 they\u2019d rather try a bunch of new ideas with a chance of getting things done faster or better than to pay attention to \u201cthe way things have always been done\u201d or subordinates\u2019 comfort with experimentation. Entrepreneurs are practical, with a focus on what does, or could, work best. This can make for a chaotic environment, but Entrepreneurs\u2019 inspiring cult of personality makes them well-suited to handling such a thing. Entrepreneurs enjoy living in the moment. Rather than some broad, intangible future accomplishment like \u201cmaking customers happy\u201d, Entrepreneur personalities set small, clear, measurable, and attainable goals that keep things on track day-to-day, and hearty congratulations can always be relied on for a job well done. Entrepreneurs keep their eyes on the finish line, but they get there step by step."}]}

Whether they\u2019re a brand-new hire or a CEO, Campaigners feel happiest when they have the time and freedom to explore new ideas. And if they can explore those ideas alongside other people who share their excitement \u2013 well, that\u2019s even better. Some personality types are sticklers for workplace hierarchies, but Campaigners see all of their colleagues as their equals. Sure, they may want to impress their boss, but chances are they want to make a good impression on everyone else as well. Campaigner Subordinates As employees, Campaigners often impress their managers with their creativity and adaptability. People with this personality type are happy to experiment with new ways of doing things and to change course when necessary. They also stand out as excellent listeners, always eager to consider other people\u2019s perspectives. Like any personality type, though, Campaigner subordinates have their pet peeves. Chief among these is micromanagement. Campaigners care about doing a good job, and they often feel that they do their best work when they can move at their own pace and do things in their own style. Constant nitpicking from their bosses can be seriously stressful for Campaigners. That said, many people with this personality type do benefit from some direct management and oversight. Campaigners are notorious for skipping ahead to a new project before they\u2019ve completed the last one. They love exploring new endeavors, but once a project\u2019s allure begins to fade, they may find it difficult to stay motivated. In this spirit, Campaigners may find it helpful to view check-ins from their bosses as accountability and encouragement \u2013 in other words, teamwork \u2013 rather than micromanagement. Campaigner Colleagues Campaigners view the people they work with not just as coworkers but as friends. People with this personality type take a genuine interest in their colleagues, curious about what makes them tick. Campaigners can be counted on to provide cheer and support whenever one of their coworkers is down or stressed. Campaigners are always on the search for win-win solutions to any problem. They don\u2019t want to succeed at other people\u2019s expense, and they rarely put down a colleague to make themselves look good. Instead, they give credit where it\u2019s due and lavish praise on anyone who does a good job. Group brainstorms are their forte. Campaigners listen to other people\u2019s viewpoints and suggestions not just with tolerance but also genuine excitement. Their ability to relax and have fun will always make these personalities popular around the watercooler. But what sets Campaigners apart is how they can transform their popularity into natural leadership, inspiring their colleagues to band together in teams and collaborate to reach their goals. Campaigner Managers Campaigner bosses don\u2019t talk down to the people who work for them. In fact, managers with this personality type behave much like they did before they were in charge \u2013 they establish real connections with their employees, and they inspire by example rather than shouting orders from behind their desks. Campaigners prefer to focus on the big picture, letting their employees use their own judgment when it comes to handling details. However, not everyone shares this perspective on leadership. In the absence of clear orders, some employees may feel that they are being expected to read Campaigners\u2019 minds. And some teams may need strict deadlines and timetables in order to succeed in their projects. For Campaigner personality types, it can be especially difficult to reprimand or fire employees \u2013 even those who deserve it. Unless they set boundaries and expectations, Campaigner bosses may end up disappointed or even taken advantage of by the people who work for them. Fortunately, these personalities have the sensitivity and insight to recognize when their team needs more structure or discipline in order to thrive. And while it may not be easy, Campaigners can use their communication skills and empathy to handle even the most challenging workplace situations in a way that is kind and fair."}]}

A Debater (ENTP) is a person with the Extraverted , Intuitive , Thinking , and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be bold and creative, deconstructing and rebuilding ideas with great mental agility. They pursue their goals vigorously despite any resistance they might encounter. Quick-witted and audacious, Debaters aren\u2019t afraid to disagree with the status quo. In fact, they\u2019re not afraid to disagree with pretty much anything or anyone. Few things light up people with this personality type more than a bit of verbal sparring \u2013 and if the conversation veers into controversial terrain, so much the better. It would be a mistake, though, to think of Debaters as disagreeable or mean-spirited. Instead, people with this personality type are knowledgeable and curious, with a playful sense of humor, and they can be incredibly entertaining. They simply have an offbeat, contrarian idea of fun \u2013 one that involves a healthy dose of spirited debate. Debaters are the ultimate devil\u2019s advocates, thriving on the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift in the wind for all to see. Breaking the Rules Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Thomas J. Watson Debaters are known for their rebellious streak. For this personality type, no belief is too sacred to be questioned, no idea is too fundamental to be scrutinized, and no rule is too important to be broken, or at least thoroughly tested. Sometimes Debaters even rebel against their own beliefs by arguing the opposing viewpoint \u2013 just to see how the world looks from the other side. As Debaters see it, most people are too ready to do as they\u2019re told and blindly conform to social norms, pressures, and standards. Debaters enjoy the mental exercise of questioning the prevailing mode of thought, and they take a certain pleasure in uncovering the value of underdogs and outliers. Their active minds can\u2019t help but rethink the things that everyone else takes for granted and push them in clever new directions. For many Debaters, one of life\u2019s greatest challenges is to translate their wide-ranging intellectual energy into real-world achievements and contributions. While Debater personalities love to brainstorm and think big, they tend to avoid getting caught doing the \u201cgrunt work\u201d of implementing their ideas. To some extent, this makes sense \u2013 Debaters have far too many thoughts and suggestions to keep track of them all, let alone turn them into reality. But unless Debaters develop the willingness to identify and actually follow through on their priorities, they may struggle to harness their full potential. The Cost of Contrarianism Debaters\u2019 capacity for debate is legendary, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s always helpful. When they openly question their boss in a meeting or pick apart everything their significant other says, Debaters may think that they\u2019re being champions of rationality and logic. But they may also be doing their chances of success and happiness more harm than good. Not every occasion calls for this personality type\u2019s default contrarianism, and most people can only stand to have their beliefs questioned and their feelings brushed aside for so long. As a result, Debaters may find that their quarrelsome fun burns many bridges, often inadvertently. Debaters are respected for their vision, confidence, knowledge, and keen sense of humor \u2013 but unless they cultivate a bit of sensitivity, they may struggle to maintain deeper relationships or even to achieve their professional goals. Many Debaters find that a more compassionate approach is worth exploring as they strive to build solid relationships. With time, many Debaters realize that their ideal life involves other people and that spending too much energy on \u201cwinning\u201d arguments ultimately means robbing themselves of the support that they need to get where they want to be in life. The good news is that people with this personality type will never lose their sharply nonconformist edge. They can simply use their cognitive flexibility to understand and explore other people\u2019s perspectives, recognizing the value of consideration and compromise alongside logic and progress."}]}

Beneath their mild, unassuming exteriors, Defenders thrum with passionate commitment and loyalty toward the people they love. At times, Defenders themselves may be surprised by the intensity of their feelings, especially their fierce desire to protect and care for their partner. Defenders\u2019 emotions run deep \u2013 so deep that people with this personality type may struggle to find the words to express just how much their partner means to them. But Defenders show their affection in a million little ways on a daily basis. Always eager to make their loved ones\u2019 lives better and more pleasant, Defenders can transform even the most prosaic of tasks \u2013 from cooking dinner to organizing a weekend trip \u2013 into a heartfelt gesture of love and care. Defenders in Love Although generally a proactive, can-do personality type, many Defenders struggle to take the initiative when it comes to dating. Asking someone out can be incredibly uncomfortable for Defenders, who tend to worry about not only rejection but also violating unspoken social rules. The bad news is that Defenders can end up feeling trapped, wanting to embark on a relationship but waiting for another person to make the first move. Many Defenders long to bring their gifts to a loving relationship, but they hesitate to take the risk of asking someone out. When they do find themselves in a relationship, Defenders are \u2013 in a word \u2013 committed. People with this personality type find great fulfillment in sharing their time, energy, and affection with another person, and as partners, they tend to be incredibly generous and supportive. They don\u2019t take their relationships lightly, and they don\u2019t give up easily \u2013 even when challenges inevitably arise. Defenders tend to have a realistic appreciation for the amount of effort that a healthy long-term relationship requires, and they\u2019re more than willing to put in the work necessary to build a lasting bond with a person they cherish. Soundness of Heart Defenders\u2019 pragmatic approach to life shields the incredibly strong feelings that lie within their hearts. It\u2019s no surprise, then, that it can take these personalities a relatively long time to recover from the heartache of a breakup \u2013 or even a particularly painful disagreement. Defenders give so much of themselves in their relationships that they can feel deeply hurt when they believe that someone isn\u2019t offering them enough love, commitment, and appreciation in return. Unfortunately, Defenders may find it difficult to break off a relationship, even when things just aren\u2019t working out. People with this personality type may hang on due to misplaced loyalty, a general fear of change, or the hope that they can somehow figure out how to change any problems for the better. It would be a mistake, however, to think of Defenders as pushovers in their relationships. Although people with this personality type generally try to avoid conflict, they have clear and firm opinions and preferences on all kinds of subjects. And when they feel as if their partner isn\u2019t respecting their wishes, all of their repressed frustration and disappointment may eventually boil over in the form of negativity, resentment, or heels-dug-in stubbornness. Defenders devote themselves to their partner, but they may feel unfulfilled unless they remember to honor their own hopes and dreams. In their heart of hearts, however, what Defenders want most is to ensure their partner\u2019s happiness. As long as they balance this desire with a healthy amount of attention to their own needs and aspirations, Defenders can enjoy exactly the sort of enduring, impassioned relationships that they\u2019ve always dreamed about."}]}

While no one could be said to be truly prepared for such a task, Adventurer personalities\u2019 natural warmth, practicality and relaxed nature help them to settle in and appreciate every moment of joy and hardship that comes with raising a child. Finding Joy in the Everyday Adventurers\u2019 greatest strength is arguably the joy they take in being with and helping their loved ones. Practical needs are taken care of from day one, and Adventurers\u2019 children can always count on something exciting to do or to learn every day. People with the Adventurer personality type love fun, hands-on activities, and as their children grow, they\u2019re often encouraged to pick up extra hobbies that revolve around those kinds of activities. Even as those extra activities grow, Adventurers often defy their Introversion (I), spending time with their children and enjoying engaging activities that center on quality time. Impromptu trips, home improvement projects like repainting bedrooms, or simply baking some treats together are all likely to being fond memories for Adventurers\u2019 children. None of this is to say that Adventurer parents are overbearing \u2013 in fact, they are one of the most relaxed personality types there is when it comes to parenting. Adventurers believe that the only way to really have their children grow up to be open-minded and well-balanced people is to let them explore and experience new things, make mistakes and learn from them, and to always know that they\u2019ll be able to come home at the end of it. Interventions and hardline rules just aren\u2019t Adventurers\u2019 style. The freedom Adventurers grant their children comes with risks too, since it demands a certain level of maturity from the children themselves. Some lessons are harder than others. These can be hard lessons for people with the Adventurer personality type too, since they are more sensitive than most when it comes to their lifestyles or parenting being criticized. Nothing\u2019s quite as unpleasant as \u201cI told you so\u201d. Long-term planning is another challenging area for Adventurer parents. When it comes to things like saving for their children\u2019s college education, Adventurers necessarily rely on partners who take care of that sort of thing more readily. The Power of Love As their children grow into adolescence, Adventurers sometimes struggle as well. Adventurer personalities need to know that their work and effort are appreciated, something teenagers aren\u2019t well-known for expressing. It can take a lot of practice on Adventurers\u2019 parts to learn the emotional control necessary to not overreact when things don\u2019t go the way they want. Children make an effort to distance themselves at that age, and private individuals or no, Adventurers need to know that their loved ones are by their sides. In the end though, Adventurers are so much less likely to create the kinds of divides that other more rigid personality types sometimes drive between themselves and their children. There\u2019s always going to be some push from developing adults, but with such warm, caring parents, Adventurers\u2019 children can always rest assured that they know where home and hearth are."}]}

No other kind of relationship provides people with the Consul personality type with the same level of support and devotion, and the feelings of security and stability that come with strong romantic relationships are extremely warming. Consuls don\u2019t do casual flings \u2013 they need to know that their partners will always be by their sides offering unwavering support, and marriage and family are the ultimate goal. With such a goal in mind, Consul personalities take each stage, from dating to everything thereafter, very seriously. Everything about Consuls\u2019 relationships is based on satisfying mutual needs, from creating understanding early on to building mutual respect and support for each other\u2019s opinions and goals. Knowing that they are loved and appreciated has a huge effect on Consuls\u2019 mood and self-esteem. A Tender Heart If they feel like this support isn\u2019t there, such as when their partners deliver criticism, Consuls can feel extremely hurt. People with the Consul personality type dislike conflict and criticism, which can make it challenging to address any problems that come up. Nothing is more hurtful or depressing to Consuls than to realize that their partners don\u2019t respect their dreams or opinions. Consuls can be surprisingly tough and tireless in the face of hardship, but they need to know without a doubt that their partners are behind them 100%. Unfortunately, less mature Consuls may lack the inner strength and wisdom to attract this in healthy ways. They can be very needy, compromising their own principles and values in exchange for their partners\u2019 approval. This is a terrible trap \u2013 not only is it unattractive, it can too easily lead to emotionally abusive relationships, which reduce Consuls\u2019 self-esteem further. Another snare is their fixation on social status and approval \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon for Consuls\u2019 social circles and relatives to play a bigger part in their choice of dating partners than even their own values. Cultivating Trust Consuls are warm, loyal people who want to feel trusted and valued. They are great with practical matters like money management and administrative tasks, and are happy to take on such responsibilities in the name of taking care of the people they care about, a wonderful quality. Consuls just need to make sure they take the time to ensure that they build relationships that allow them to satisfy their own needs and dreams, with partners who appreciate their care and generosity fully, and who reciprocate as well. Consuls are often very organized in how their relationships develop, following established dating rules and traditions (don\u2019t call first, third date, etc.). As their relationships enter more sexual stages, Consuls\u2019 emphasis on process and tradition continue with established gender roles and socially acceptable activities. However, since Consuls are so centered on the physical world and are quite emotional, they tend to be very affectionate and sensual, and overall great sexual partners. People with this personality type love to find ways to make their partners happy, and this sort of intimacy is a great way to do so. As the two partners become more comfortable with each other, Consuls are often open to experimenting and trying new things, so long as their partners are willing to reciprocate. Consuls have specific needs for their relationships, and certain personality types are best able to meet those needs. In general, partners should share Consuls\u2019 Observant (S) trait, but it can also be useful to develop a sense of introspection that Introverted (I) partners can provide, with maybe one more opposing trait to help Consuls focus on logical decisions when appropriate, or to be more open-minded in new situations."}]}

An Executive (ESTJ) is someone with the Extraverted , Observant , Thinking , and Judging personality traits. They possess great fortitude, emphatically following their own sensible judgment. They often serve as a stabilizing force among others, able to offer solid direction amid adversity. Good order is the foundation of all things. Edmund Burke Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together. Leading by Example Demand for such leadership is high in democratic societies, and forming no less than 11% of the population, it\u2019s no wonder that many of America\u2019s presidents have been Executives. Strong believers in the rule of law and authority that must be earned, Executive personalities lead by example, demonstrating dedication and purposeful honesty, and an utter rejection of laziness and cheating, especially in work. If anyone declares hard, manual work to be an excellent way to build character, it is Executives. Executives are aware of their surroundings and live in a world of clear, verifiable facts \u2013 the surety of their knowledge means that even against heavy resistance, they stick to their principles and push an unclouded vision of what is and is not acceptable. Their opinions aren\u2019t just empty talk either, as Executives are more than willing to dive into the most challenging projects, improving action plans and sorting details along the way, making even the most complicated tasks seem easy and approachable. However, Executives don\u2019t work alone, and they expect their reliability and work ethic to be reciprocated \u2013 people with this personality type meet their promises, and if partners or subordinates jeopardize them through incompetence or laziness, or worse still, dishonesty, they do not hesitate to show their wrath. This can earn them a reputation for inflexibility, a trait shared by all Sentinel personalities, but it\u2019s not because Executives are arbitrarily stubborn, but because they truly believe that these values are what make society work. A Greater Responsibility Executives are classic images of the model citizen: they help their neighbors, uphold the law, and try to make sure that everyone participates in the communities and organizations they hold so dear. The main challenge for Executives is to recognize that not everyone follows the same path or contributes in the same way. A true leader recognizes the strength of the individual, as well as that of the group, and helps bring those individuals\u2019 ideas to the table. That way, Executives really do have all the facts, and are able to lead the charge in directions that work for everyone."}]}

This is a passionate, warm, openhearted personality type \u2013 one that brims with hopes and dreams, ideas and experiences \u2013 and Campaigners bring every ounce of this vibrant energy to their romantic relationships. For Campaigners, romantic relationships are beautiful and exhilarating \u2013 an opportunity for two souls not only to explore the world together but also to connect on the deepest of levels. Many Campaigners harbor a deep longing to share their lives with another person. As a result, these personalities may feel a bit empty or uninspired when they\u2019re single. While their dedication to relationships is admirable, Campaigners may need to guard against investing too much of their sense of self in their relationship status. Fanning the Flames When Campaigners are interested in someone, they rarely hold back. People with this personality type tend to fall in love easily \u2013 and they fall hard . Campaigners shower their new flame with affection, trusting that the devotion and passion that they feel are real. Optimists at heart, Campaigners are undaunted by the practical challenges and inconveniences of a new partnership. This might explain why they generally don\u2019t shy away from long-distance relationships \u2013 in their minds, physical distance is no match for the power of true love. Rather than focusing on potential issues, Campaigners sink into the joys of a relationship\u2019s honeymoon stage, constantly looking for ways to prove their dedication and delight their partner. In a world of dating games and rules, Campaigners\u2019 willingness to throw caution to the wind can be a breath of fresh air. For better or for worse, not everyone can match this personality type\u2019s ardor and intensity. Some people just need more space \u2013 whether physical, emotional, or both. If their partner\u2019s enthusiasm doesn\u2019t seem to match their own, Campaigners may find themselves feeling insecure or needy. And when the flames of romance start to flicker or wane \u2013 as happens in nearly every longer-term relationship \u2013 Campaigners might worry that their devotion has been misplaced and the match isn\u2019t meant to be after all. The Mystery of Relationships Perhaps because they\u2019re so unstinting with their affection, Campaigners can struggle with the mystery of why some relationships don\u2019t work out. Shouldn\u2019t love be enough to keep two people happily together \u2013 especially when one of those partners is as eager to please as a Campaigner? But, like everyone, people with this personality type need to remember that relationships are in all ways mutual \u2013 mutual interest, mutual growth, and mutual responsibility. As many Campaigners learn, the fate of a relationship has less to do with whether it was \u201cmeant to be\u201d in some cosmic sense than with how partners treat and communicate with each other. Campaigners know that lasting love takes effort and commitment \u2013 but they may become alarmed when the work of being in a relationship starts to feel like, well, work. Cherished Ideals Campaigners approach their relationships with the highest of ideals. They long to know and unconditionally accept everything about their partner, just as they long for that person to know and unconditionally accept them in return. With this intense, all-in approach to love, Campaigners may feel more energized in the exciting, unpredictable early stages of a courtship than they do in established relationships. After all, long-term relationships require two people not just to enjoy each other\u2019s company but also to navigate practical matters together, such as chores, budgeting, and social or family obligations. In settled relationships, Campaigner personalities may find themselves longing for the days when they and their partner were more focused on candlelit dinners than who was going to empty the dishwasher. For Campaigners, such issues can seem painfully unromantic. But unless these types take on their share of the responsibilities and help keep things running smoothly, they may actually amplify any stress and resentment in the relationship. Fortunately, Campaigners can find ways to balance their spontaneous, passionate nature with the stability and consistency that long-term relationships require. With their trademark sensitivity and goodwill, these personalities can transform even the most mundane tasks into a creative, heartfelt expression of love."}]}

Though there are many directions they can choose to go, people with the Executive personality type almost always end up in situations where they have the opportunity to exercise their affinity for organization, structure, and follow-through. Providing further focus, Executives share a profound respect for tradition, stability and security, qualities which lend themselves well to progressing along clear paths to increased responsibility and dependability. Executives\u2019 sense of loyalty results in them staying with a single employer as long as possible, and their reverence for established institutions often leads to work with well-respected organizations. Law enforcement, military service, hospitals and prominent legal firms are all able to recognize Executives\u2019 long years of service. Executive personalities rise to the occasion and meet their obligations with enviable consistency, making them clear choices for advancement. Executives are the image of the model citizen, and they strive to maintain this ideal throughout their careers. This helps them move forward into management as well \u2013 people with this personality type have many traits inherent to leadership, something that is often recognized regardless of their chosen industry. From the genuine enjoyment Executives feel in organizing other people to their knack for clearly expressing their principles, values and expectations, Executives are extremely effective managers. Also fearsome leaders, Executives loathe disorganization, ineptitude, laziness and especially dishonesty, and when these values are crossed, Executive personalities do not hesitate to let their disapproval show. So long as everyone plays by the rules, Executives are incredibly efficient, their love of structure and thoroughness leaving a record of accurate, complete work that is on time and on budget. Executives are natural auditors, financial officers and business administrators, and any such and similar roles are excellent choices for them. The Value of Hard Work Hard work and self-motivation are also strong Executive principles, which makes them excellent sales representatives, whether in basic retail positions, part of office teams, or as independent agents. People with the Executive personality type stick to projects until they\u2019re finished, big or small, and are organized enough to make any necessary paperwork a mere minor inconvenience to their clients, rather than some baffling ordeal. These qualities combine to make the clear steps in advancement that Executives require in order to maintain a sense of accomplishment not just viable, but almost inevitable."}]}

For the most part, people with this personality type aren\u2019t obsessed with being popular. They don\u2019t spend their time and energy on just anyone, and they can be difficult to get to know. It would be a mistake, however, to label this personality type as antisocial or unfriendly. Architects do enjoy the pleasure of their own company and their own mind, but they also crave meaningful connections with friends. In fact, few things are more exhilarating to an Architect than the spark that they feel when they\u2019re immersed in conversation with someone who really gets them. An Intellectual Match It\u2019s not always easy to befriend an Architect. People with this personality type have little patience for social rules or expectations, and they\u2019d rather spend time alone than with someone who bores or irritates them. Architects tend to have a clear idea of what they expect from their social lives and their friends, and they don\u2019t want to waste too much time on anyone who doesn\u2019t seem to meet these expectations. Architects care about depth and quality. They\u2019d rather have just a few good friends than a large circle of acquaintances. From the outside, this might sound dismissive, but the truth is that many Architects have a knack for finding friends in seemingly unlikely places. These personalities aren\u2019t particularly swayed by appearances or social status, so they aren\u2019t afraid to befriend people who might be thought of as \u201coutsiders\u201d by the mainstream. In sizing up a potential friend, Architects don\u2019t particularly care how popular that person is \u2013 instead, they consider whether that person has values that are compatible with their own, such as intellect, honesty, self-improvement, or simply a different perspective. In friendship, Architects are looking for an intellectual match as much as anything else. These personalities crave mental stimulation, and they tend to have the most fun among friends who can challenge their ideas, expose them to new concepts, and steer conversations in unexpected directions. A Unique Friendship In their friendships, as in other aspects of their lives, Architects prize independence. Social obligations can feel stifling to people with this personality type. Architects don\u2019t want to feel beholden to their friends, and they don\u2019t want their friends to feel beholden to them. For them, an ideal friendship is low drama, based on true enjoyment of each other\u2019s company rather than obligation. Even with their closest friends, Architects may struggle to offer emotional comfort \u2013 or receive it. Of course, any long-term friendship will have its dramatic moments. When sensitive or emotional situations arise, Architects may feel out of their depth. Architects are used to feeling knowledgeable and capable, and this sudden cluelessness can be disorienting for them. Many people with this personality type have to practice listening to their friends in a nonjudgmental, supportive way rather than jumping in immediately with solutions and advice. The good news is that, among friends they know and respect, Architects have no trouble relaxing and being themselves. Architects\u2019 sarcasm and witty banter may not be for everyone \u2013 especially people who struggle to read between the lines. But these personalities reward their true friends with candor and insight, along with an endless supply of fascinating stories, ideas, and conversations."}]}

Virtuoso women are especially rare, and the typical gender roles that society tends to expect can be a poor fit \u2013 they\u2019ll often be seen as tomboys from a young age. Dare to Differ While their mechanical tendencies can make them appear simple at a glance, Virtuosos are actually quite enigmatic. Friendly but very private, calm but suddenly spontaneous, extremely curious but unable to stay focused on formal studies, Virtuoso personalities can be a challenge to predict, even by their friends and loved ones. Virtuosos can seem very loyal and steady for a while, but they tend to build up a store of impulsive energy that explodes without warning, taking their interests in bold new directions. Rather than some sort of vision quest though, Virtuosos are merely exploring the viability of a new interest when they make these seismic shifts. Virtuosos\u2019 decisions stem from a sense of practical realism, and at their heart is a strong sense of direct fairness, a \u201cdo unto others\u201d attitude, which really helps to explain many of Virtuosos\u2019 puzzling traits. Instead of being overly cautious though, avoiding stepping on toes in order to avoid having their toes stepped on, Virtuosos are likely to go too far, accepting likewise retaliation, good or bad, as fair play. The biggest issue Virtuosos are likely to face is that they often act too soon, taking for granted their permissive nature and assuming that others are the same. They\u2019ll be the first to tell an insensitive joke, get overly involved in someone else\u2019s project, roughhouse and play around, or suddenly change their plans because something more interesting came up. Defying the Rules Virtuosos will come to learn that many other personality types have much more firmly drawn lines on rules and acceptable behavior than they do \u2013 they don\u2019t want to hear an insensitive joke, and certainly wouldn\u2019t tell one back, and they wouldn\u2019t want to engage in horseplay, even with a willing party. If a situation is already emotionally charged, violating these boundaries can backfire tremendously. Virtuosos have a particular difficulty in predicting emotions, but this is just a natural extension of their fairness, given how difficult it is to gauge Virtuosos\u2019 emotions and motivations. However, their tendency to explore their relationships through their actions rather than through empathy can lead to some very frustrating situations. People with the Virtuoso personality type struggle with boundaries and guidelines, preferring the freedom to move about and color outside the lines if they need to. Finding an environment where they can work with good friends who understand their style and unpredictability, combining their creativity, sense of humor and hands-on approach to build practical solutions and things, will give Virtuosos many happy years of building useful boxes \u2013 and admiring them from the outside."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "INTP's Workplace habits"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Workplace Habits For Logicians, the ingredients for workplace satisfaction are fairly simple. People with this personality type crave intellectual stimulation, freedom to pursue their ideas, and opportunities to solve challenging puzzles. And if they can fulfill these needs with minimal social obligations and humdrum administrative tasks, so much the better. Though some Logicians may scoff at the notion, they often do their best work in collaboration with other people. These personalities tend to live in their heads, coming up with thoughts and insights faster than they know what to do with them. Logicians may sometimes feel irritated when managers or coworkers force them to slow down and figure out how to implement their ideas \u2013 but in the long term, such colleagues can be the secret to Logicians\u2019 success. Logician Subordinates Under the right conditions, Logician employees are innovative and resourceful, easily wrapping their minds around whatever complex problems are placed in front of them. But in work environments that limit their independence or force them to do \u201cgrunt work,\u201d these personalities may lose motivation quickly. This can create an unfortunate catch-22. Logicians are often tempted to put off tasks that seem boring or beneath them, but until they \u201cpay their dues\u201d by doing these tasks, their bosses probably won\u2019t grant them the freedom and latitude that they crave. Although Logicians might wish that they could just skip ahead to the interesting stuff, they need to prove themselves to their managers first. There\u2019s good news, though: Logicians\u2019 time at the bottom of the job ladder can actually help them build new skills and habits that will help them succeed later on. People with this personality type have many strengths, but completing projects doesn\u2019t tend to be one of them. Logicians can chafe at the oversight and limitations that they encounter early in their careers \u2013 or they can use the additional accountability and structure to their advantage, learning to become more effective at turning their ideas into reality. Logician Colleagues At times, Logicians may see their colleagues not as a group of people to socialize and work with but rather as a series of potential distractions who sometimes provide useful knowledge. This isn\u2019t to say that people with this personality type never enjoy their coworkers\u2019 company, but the prospect of watercooler chitchat isn\u2019t going to get Logicians out of bed in the morning. That said, most Logicians can benefit from their colleagues more than they might realize. By surrounding themselves with people who challenge them, these personalities can make sure that they\u2019re actually doing their best work. And although Logicians aren\u2019t exactly social butterflies, they often find that the workday goes by a little faster when they have a chance to bounce their ideas off of coworkers they respect. Although people with this personality type might say they love to focus, they secretly crave variety too. Logicians who build positive relationships are more likely to get asked to contribute their ideas and expertise to new projects. If they want to stay on the cutting edge of the most interesting new things happening at their workplace, Logicians would do well to establish themselves as helpful collaborators, not lone wolves. Logician Managers Logicians generally don\u2019t care about having power over others, but they often enjoy management positions. When they\u2019re in charge, people with this personality type can delegate the administrative tasks that make their eyes glaze over and focus on the good stuff: coming up with new ideas. As managers, Logicians tend to be tolerant and flexible. They\u2019re open to suggestions (as long as those suggestions are logical, of course), and they allow their employees a fair amount of freedom. But this freedom comes at a cost \u2013 Logician managers have high standards, and they expect others to grasp their insights instantly and provide their own in equal measure. Bosses with this personality type can have a reputation for being exacting. They quickly pick up on discrepancies in their employees\u2019 work, and they may not hold back when it comes to doling out negative feedback. As they gain experience, Logician managers often discover that balancing criticism with praise and encouragement allows their team to enjoy higher morale \u2013 and, just as importantly, better results."}]}

An Entrepreneur (ESTP) is someone with the Extraverted , Observant , Thinking , and Prospecting personality traits. They tend to be energetic and action-oriented, deftly navigating whatever is in front of them. They love uncovering life\u2019s opportunities, whether socializing with others or in more personal pursuits. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing at all. Helen Keller Entrepreneurs always have an impact on their immediate surroundings \u2013 the best way to spot them at a party is to look for the whirling eddy of people flitting about them as they move from group to group. Laughing and entertaining with a blunt and earthy humor, Entrepreneur personalities love to be the center of attention. If an audience member is asked to come on stage, Entrepreneurs volunteer \u2013 or volunteer a shy friend. Theory, abstract concepts and plodding discussions about global issues and their implications don\u2019t keep Entrepreneurs interested for long. Entrepreneurs keep their conversation energetic, with a good dose of intelligence, but they like to talk about what is \u2013 or better yet, to just go out and do it. Entrepreneurs leap before they look, fixing their mistakes as they go, rather than sitting idle, preparing contingencies and escape clauses. Diving Right In Entrepreneurs are the likeliest personality type to make a lifestyle of risky behavior. They live in the moment and dive into the action \u2013 they are the eye of the storm. People with the Entrepreneur personality type enjoy drama, passion, and pleasure, not for emotional thrills, but because it\u2019s so stimulating to their logical minds. They are forced to make critical decisions based on factual, immediate reality in a process of rapid-fire rational stimulus response. This makes school and other highly organized environments a challenge for Entrepreneurs. It certainly isn\u2019t because they aren\u2019t smart, and they can do well, but the regimented, lecturing approach of formal education is just so far from the hands-on learning that Entrepreneurs enjoy. It takes a great deal of maturity to see this process as a necessary means to an end, something that creates more exciting opportunities. Also challenging is that to Entrepreneurs, it makes more sense to use their own moral compass than someone else\u2019s. Rules were made to be broken. This is a sentiment few high school instructors or corporate supervisors are likely to share, and can earn Entrepreneur personalities a certain reputation. But if they minimize the trouble-making, harness their energy, and focus through the boring stuff, Entrepreneurs are a force to be reckoned with. The Path Less Traveled With perhaps the most perceptive, unfiltered view of any type, Entrepreneurs have a unique skill in noticing small changes. Whether a shift in facial expression, a new clothing style, or a broken habit, people with this personality type pick up on hidden thoughts and motives where most types would be lucky to pick up anything specific at all. Entrepreneurs use these observations immediately, calling out the change and asking questions, often with little regard for sensitivity. Entrepreneurs should remember that not everyone wants their secrets and decisions broadcast. Sometimes Entrepreneurs\u2019 instantaneous observation and action is just what\u2019s required, as in some corporate environments, and especially in emergencies. If Entrepreneurs aren\u2019t careful though, they may get too caught in the moment, take things too far, and run roughshod over more sensitive people, or forget to take care of their own health and safety. Making up only four percent of the population, there are just enough Entrepreneurs out there to keep things spicy and competitive, and not so many as to cause a systemic risk. Entrepreneurs are full of passion and energy, complemented by a rational, if sometimes distracted, mind. Inspiring, convincing and colorful, they are natural group leaders, pulling everyone along the path less traveled, bringing life and excitement everywhere they go. Putting these qualities to a constructive and rewarding end is Entrepreneurs\u2019 true challenge."}]}

Emotional manipulation, mind games and reassuring lies all run counter to Logisticians\u2019 preference for managing the reality of the situations they encounter with plain and simple honesty. Strong-willed and Dutiful \u2013 Logisticians embody that integrity in their actions too, working hard and staying focused on their goals. Patient and determined, people with the Logistician personality type meet their obligations, period. Very Responsible \u2013 Logisticians\u2019 word is a promise, and a promise means everything. Logisticians would rather run themselves into the ground with extra days and lost sleep than fail to deliver the results they said they would. Loyalty is a strong sentiment for Logistician personalities, and they fulfill their duties to the people and organizations they\u2019ve committed themselves to. Calm and Practical \u2013 None of their promises would mean much if Logisticians lost their tempers and broke down at every sign of hardship \u2013 they keep their feet on the ground and make clear, rational decisions. Peoples\u2019 preferences are a factor to consider in this process, and Logisticians work to make the best use of individual qualities, but these decisions are made with effectiveness in mind more so than empathy. The same applies to criticisms, for others and themselves. Create and Enforce Order \u2013 The primary goal of any Logistician is to be effective in what they\u2019ve chosen to do, and they believe that this is accomplished best when everyone involved knows exactly what is going on and why. Unclear guidelines and people who break established rules undermine this effort, and are rarely tolerated by Logisticians. Structure and rules foster dependability; chaos creates unforeseen setbacks and missed deadlines. Jacks-of-all-trades \u2013 Much like Analyst personality types, Logisticians are proud repositories of knowledge, though the emphasis is more on facts and statistics than concepts and underlying principles. This allows Logisticians to apply themselves to a variety of situations, picking up and applying new data and grasping the details of challenging situations as a matter of course. Logistician Weaknesses Stubborn \u2013 The facts are the facts, and Logisticians tend to resist any new idea that isn\u2019t supported by them. This factual decision-making process also makes it difficult for people with the Logistician personality type to accept that they were wrong about something \u2013 but anyone can miss a detail, even them. Insensitive \u2013 While not intentionally harsh, Logisticians often hurt more sensitive types\u2019 feelings by the simple mantra that honesty is the best policy. Logistician personalities may take emotions into consideration, but really only so far as to determine the most effective way to say what needs to be said. Always by the Book \u2013 Logisticians believe that things work best with clearly defined rules, but this makes them reluctant to bend those rules or try new things, even when the downside is minimal. Truly unstructured environments leave Logisticians all but paralyzed. Judgmental \u2013 Opinions are opinions and facts are facts, and Logisticians are unlikely to respect people who disagree with those facts, or especially those who remain willfully ignorant of them. Often Unreasonably Blame Themselves \u2013 All this can combine to make Logisticians believe they are the only ones who can see projects through reliably. As they load themselves with extra work and responsibilities, turning away good intentions and helpful ideas, Logisticians sooner or later hit a tipping point where they simply can\u2019t deliver. Since they\u2019ve heaped the responsibility on themselves, Logisticians then believe the responsibility for failure is theirs alone to bear."}]}

This information isn\u2019t usually absorbed for any planned purpose as with dedicated studying, people with the Debater personality type just find it fascinating. Quick Thinkers \u2013 Debaters have tremendously flexible minds, and are able to shift from idea to idea without effort, drawing on their accumulated knowledge to prove their points, or their opponents\u2019, as they see fit. Original \u2013 Having little attachment to tradition, Debater personalities are able to discard existing systems and methods and pull together disparate ideas from their extensive knowledge base, with a little raw creativity to hold them together, to formulate bold new ideas. If presented with chronic, systemic problems and given rein to solve them, Debaters respond with unabashed glee. Excellent Brainstormers \u2013 Nothing is quite as enjoyable to Debaters as analyzing problems from every angle to find the best solutions. Combining their knowledge and originality to splay out every aspect of the subject at hand, rejecting without remorse options that don\u2019t work and presenting ever more possibilities, Debaters are irreplaceable in brainstorming sessions. Charismatic \u2013 People with the Debater personality type have a way with words and wit that others find intriguing. Their confidence, quick thought and ability to connect disparate ideas in novel ways create a style of communication that is charming, even entertaining, and informative at the same time. Energetic \u2013 When given a chance to combine these traits to examine an interesting problem, Debaters can be truly impressive in their enthusiasm and energy, having no qualms with putting in long days and nights to find a solution. Debater Weaknesses Very Argumentative \u2013 If there\u2019s anything Debaters enjoy, it\u2019s the mental exercise of debating an idea, and nothing is sacred. More consensus-oriented personality types rarely appreciate the vigor with which Debater personalities tear down their beliefs and methods, leading to a great deal of tension. Insensitive \u2013 Being so rational, Debaters often misjudge others feelings and push their debates well past others\u2019 tolerance levels. People with this personality type don\u2019t really consider emotional points to be valid in such debates either, which magnifies the issue tremendously. Intolerant \u2013 Unless people are able to back up their ideas in a round of mental sparring, Debaters are likely to dismiss not just the ideas but the people themselves. Either a suggestion can stand up to rational scrutiny or it\u2019s not worth bothering with. Can Find It Difficult to Focus \u2013 The same flexibility that allows Debaters to come up with such original plans and ideas makes them readapt perfectly good ones far too often, or to even drop them entirely as the initial excitement wanes and newer thoughts come along. Boredom comes too easily for Debaters, and fresh thoughts are the solution, though not always a helpful one. Dislike Practical Matters \u2013 Debaters are interested in what could be \u2013 malleable concepts like ideas and plans that can be adapted and debated. When it comes to hard details and day-to-day execution where creative flair isn\u2019t just unnecessary but actually counter-productive, Debater personalities lose interest, often with the consequence of their plans never seeing the light of day."}]}

People with this personality type embrace their creative side, always on the lookout for opportunities to express themselves and think outside the box. Insightful \u2013 These personalities know all too well that appearances can be misleading. Advocates strive to move beyond superficiality and seek out the deeper truths in life. This can give them an almost uncanny ability to understand people\u2019s true motivations, feelings, and needs. Principled \u2013 Advocates tend to have strong beliefs and values, particularly when it comes to matters of ethics. When Advocates talk about topics close to their heart, their conviction and heartfelt idealism can inspire and persuade even the sternest of skeptics. Passionate \u2013 Advocates crave a sense of purpose in life. Rather than living on autopilot or sticking to the status quo, they want to chase after their ideals. This isn\u2019t a personality type that shies away from big dreams \u2013 in fact, Advocates are energized and impassioned by the beauty of their visions for the future. Altruistic \u2013 People with this personality type aren\u2019t happy to succeed at another person\u2019s expense. Advocates want to use their strengths for the greater good, and they rarely lose sight of how their words and actions might affect others. In their heart of hearts, they want to make the world a better place, starting with the people around them. Advocate (INFJ) Weaknesses Sensitive to Criticism \u2013 Advocates aren\u2019t averse to feedback \u2013 that is, unless they believe that someone is challenging their most cherished principles or values. When it comes to the issues that are near and dear to them, people with this personality type can become defensive or dismissive. Reluctant to Open Up \u2013 Advocates value honesty and authenticity, but they\u2019re also private. They may find it difficult to open up and be vulnerable about their struggles, not wanting to burden someone else with their issues. Unfortunately, when Advocates don\u2019t ask for help, they may inadvertently hold themselves back or create distance in their relationships. Perfectionistic \u2013 The Advocate personality type is all but defined by idealism. While this is a wonderful quality in many ways, it doesn\u2019t always leave room for the messiness of real life. Advocates might find it difficult to appreciate their jobs, living situations, or relationships if they\u2019re continually fixating on imperfections and wondering whether they should be looking for something better. Avoiding the Ordinary \u2013 Advocates yearn to do extraordinary things with their lives. But it\u2019s hard to achieve anything extraordinary without breaking it down into small, manageable steps. Unless they translate their dreams into everyday routines and to-do lists, Advocates may struggle to turn their grand visions into reality. Prone to Burnout \u2013 Advocates\u2019 perfectionism and reserve leave them with few options for letting off steam. People with this personality type can exhaust themselves if they don\u2019t balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care and rest."}]}

In all positions, the Logistician personality type seeks structure, clearly defined rules, and respect for authority and hierarchy. Responsibilities aren\u2019t burdens to Logisticians, they are the trust that has been placed in them, an opportunity to prove once again that they are the right person for the job. On the other hand, the change that comes with assuming those new responsibilities, or in losing old ones, is often a significant struggle for Logisticians. This presents itself differently in different positions of authority, but it is one of Logisticians\u2019 most significant challenges to overcome. The usual insensitivity common to all Thinking (T) types is also a running theme here, something many people with the Logistician personality type choose to focus on in their personal and professional development. Logistician Subordinates Logisticians crave responsibility, which makes them the go-to subordinates for odds and ends and unpopular projects. Often seen as jacks of all trades, Logistician personalities can competently tackle any project that comes with a manual. On the other hand, this makes them reluctant to give up responsibilities even when they are overburdened, or when there are better people for the job. The seriousness in Logisticians\u2019 approach to their work makes them surprisingly sensitive to criticism, leading to a sometimes vexing level of inflexibility. Their stubbornness aside, or perhaps because of it, Logisticians are quite possibly one of the most productive subordinates \u2013 they respect authority and hierarchy, and have no problem following orders and instructions. Punctuality is unlikely to ever be an issue, either in terms of showing up to work on time, or in terms of meeting project deadlines. While Logisticians may need clearly set steps and well-defined responsibilities, they are exceptionally loyal, dedicated, meticulous and patient in completing their work. Logistician Colleagues Among colleagues, no one can be trusted more to ensure that projects are finished on time and by the book than Logisticians. Quiet and methodical, people with the Logistician personality type keep cool when the going gets tough, but expect their colleagues to share their approach. Significantly different types, especially more emotional ones, baffle Logisticians with their need for emotional support and openness, or capacity for dropping something, half finished. To Logisticians, either something\u2019s been done right or it\u2019s been done wrong, and sugarcoating it or walking away isn\u2019t going to fix it. Logisticians value peace and security in the workplace, and the easiest way for this to happen is for them to simply work alone. Innovations, brainstorming, theories and new ideas all disrupt this comfortable state, and it takes a great deal of respect on Logisticians\u2019 part to acknowledge their validity. Once the details have been laid out and a plan of implementation established though, Logisticians are an indispensable part of the team in putting these ideas into practice. Logistician Managers Logisticians love responsibility and the power resulting from it. Pressing themselves hard to meet their obligations, Logisticians regularly go above and beyond their duties, and expect their subordinates to act with the same level of dedication. At the same time, Logisticians\u2019 preference for doing things by the book, adherence to hierarchy, and general aversion to innovation makes their subordinates ride a very thin line when they do \u2013 stepping out of bounds must be backed up with just the facts, and results. It is said that it is better to do first and ask permission later \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to say whether this applies to Logisticians, as they are very intolerant of their subordinates\u2019 failures to meet their obligations, and one of those obligations is to stick to the plan. Believing that truth, at least as far as they see it, is more important than sensitivity, Logistician personalities are capable of laying down hard criticism, and their willingness to make tough decisions can make perceived insubordination the final trespass."}]}

As parents, they are guided by a deep sense of purpose. Specifically, they see it as their mission to help their children grow into their best, kindest, most capable selves. To do this, Protagonists strive to create a loving, encouraging, and supportive home life for their children. Parents with this personality type promote creativity and authenticity, freeing their children to speak their minds and be themselves. For Protagonists, one of the greatest rewards of parenthood is watching their children blossom into their unique personalities. Life\u2019s Most Important Lessons This doesn\u2019t mean that Protagonists adopt an \u201canything goes\u201d mindset. Like all parents, these personality types occasionally pull rank and tell their children to do something \u201cbecause I said so.\u201d In their heart of hearts, however, Protagonists want to make sure that their children do the right thing out of understanding, not blind obedience. Protagonist parents see it as their loving duty to help their children realize their unique potential. These types usually set clear, age-appropriate rules and boundaries, so that their children understand the consequences of behavior that\u2019s irresponsible or unkind. Even when Protagonist parents behave strictly, however, they do so out of love \u2013 in an effort to instill in their children strong values and a sense of personal responsibility. Fortunately, these idealistic, good-natured parents can explain the difference between right and wrong in ways that uplift and inspire their children. And just as importantly, Protagonist personalities teach by example, modeling the kinds of behaviors that they hope their children will emulate. Great Expectations Parents with this personality type have high standards for their children. These expectations generally come with the best of intentions \u2013 Protagonists simply want to be sure that their children are on a path toward a meaningful, fulfilling life that makes good use of their potential. Protagonist parents pride themselves on their ability to see what each person brings to the world \u2013 a trait that helps them recognize all the ways in which their children are gifted and capable. At times, however, Protagonists\u2019 expectations may seem overwhelming to their children. Children of Protagonist personalities may sometimes feel that they need to earn their parents\u2019 love by meeting their standards \u2013 standards that might seem impossibly difficult to reach. In these situations, Protagonists may need to reassure their children that they are loved for who they are, not what they do. A Bedrock of Support Fortunately, Protagonists\u2019 sensitivity helps them appreciate their children\u2019s deeper needs, including the need for acceptance. Even as they urge their children to grow and learn and chase their dreams, parents with this personality type can offer a bedrock of emotional support that stays with their children for all their lives. Whatever their children need in order to thrive, Protagonist parents dedicate the time and energy necessary to provide it. As they mature, Protagonists\u2019 children rarely lose sight of the genuine warmth, care, love, and encouragement that they received from their parents. These children tend to grow up with a deep appreciation for lessons that have been woven into the fabric of their character, including honesty, empathy, accountability, and the vital importance of doing the right thing."}]}

There is no greater joy for Entrepreneurs than pushing boundaries and discovering and using new things and ideas. Rational and Practical \u2013 Entrepreneurs love knowledge and philosophy, but not for their own sake.

If a discussion is completely arbitrary, there are better uses for Entrepreneurs\u2019 time. Original \u2013 Combining their boldness and practicality, Entrepreneurs love to experiment with new ideas and solutions. They put things together in ways no one else would think to. Perceptive \u2013 This originality is helped by Entrepreneurs\u2019 ability to notice when things change \u2013 and when they need to change! Small shifts in habits and appearances stick out to Entrepreneurs, and they use these observations to help create connections with others. Direct \u2013 This perceptive skill isn\u2019t used for mind games \u2013 Entrepreneurs prefer to communicate clearly, with direct and factual questions and answers. Things are what they are. Sociable \u2013 All these qualities pull together to make a natural group leader in Entrepreneurs.

Entrepreneur Weaknesses Insensitive \u2013 Feelings and emotions come second to facts and \u201creality\u201d for Entrepreneurs. Emotionally charged situations are awkward, uncomfortable affairs, and Entrepreneurs\u2019 blunt honesty doesn\u2019t help here. These personalities often have a lot of trouble acknowledging and expressing their own feelings as well. Impatient \u2013 Entrepreneurs move at their own pace to keep themselves excited. Slowing down because someone else \u201cdoesn\u2019t get it\u201d or having to stay focused on a single detail for too long is extremely challenging for Entrepreneurs. Risk-prone \u2013 This impatience can lead Entrepreneurs to push into uncharted territory without thinking of the long-term consequences. Entrepreneur personalities sometimes intentionally combat boredom with extra risk. Unstructured \u2013 Entrepreneurs see an opportunity \u2013 to fix a problem, to advance, to have fun \u2013 and seize the moment, often ignoring rules and social expectations in the process. This may get things done, but it can create unexpected social fallout. May Miss the Bigger Picture \u2013 Living in the moment can cause Entrepreneurs to miss the forest for the trees. People with this personality type love to solve problems here and now, perhaps too much. All parts of a project can be perfect, but the project will still fail if those parts do not fit together. Defiant \u2013 Entrepreneurs won\u2019t be boxed in. Repetition, hardline rules, sitting quietly while they are lectured at \u2013 this isn\u2019t how Entrepreneurs live their lives. They are action-oriented and hands-on. Environments like school and much entry-level work can be so tedious that they\u2019re intolerable, requiring extraordinary effort from Entrepreneurs to stay focused long enough to get to freer positions."}]}

These personality traits tend to most affect confidence, self-esteem, susceptibility to stress, and emotional reactivity. How Debaters show these effects can be seen in several areas of life. Social Interaction Debaters are socially forward, and Identity can affect how and why. Turbulent Debaters (ENTP-T) notably seek attention and approval, while Assertive Debaters (ENTP-A) usually show less need for positive feedback. Both personalities enjoy social status, but most Assertive Debaters approach it confidently, with a sense of being accepted. Though outgoing, their Turbulent counterparts often wrestle with self-consciousness when among other people. 73% of Turbulent Debaters say they are often afraid of being rejected by other people, versus 29% of Assertive Debaters. \u201cRELYING ON OTHERS\u201d SURVEY This difference in confidence affects how Debater personalities relate with others. While Debaters generally aren\u2019t focused on their feelings, Turbulent Debaters are relatively more willing to talk about them with others and tend to devote more effort to actively dealing with their negative feelings. A notable majority of Turbulent Debaters say they work hard to get their anxieties, worries, and feelings under control, versus only half of Assertive Debaters. Turbulence may open the door to healthy self-examination and growth for this personality type. 77% of Turbulent Debaters say they get angry more easily than most people, compared to 37% of Assertive Debaters. \u201cAnger Management\u201d survey However, Identity affects conflicts as well. Most Debaters generally enjoy being provocateurs, but Turbulent Debaters are themselves more easily provoked to anger, jealousy, or envy. Assertive Debaters\u2019 self-assurance helps stabilize them \u2013 they\u2019re willingly feisty but less reactive. Endeavor and Accomplishment When it comes to goals and accomplishments, Debater personalities are usually optimistic risk-takers with little inhibition. However, when their impulses lead to unwanted outcomes, Identity differences become more apparent. 82% of Assertive Debaters say they feel like they are in control, even when things are going wrong, compared to 53% of Turbulent Debaters. \u201cHandling Stress\u201d Survey But while Assertive Debaters may not react as negatively or openly to problems, they also may not put as much effort into self-monitoring or feel as ashamed of any missteps. Their sense of comfort with themselves applies regardless of the results of their thoughts or actions. 64% of Turbulent Debaters say they see many of their mistakes as failures, versus 39% of Assertive Debaters. \u201cThought Patterns\u201d Survey Turbulent variants are also more likely to react to failure with vocal defensiveness or blaming themselves or others and to respond more vigorously to criticism. Debater personality types, in general, can be quite willful and competitive, though Assertive Debaters are less likely to be annoyed when someone else is better at something. Their self-confidence is more durable, even when their success or superiority is uncertain. Self-Perception Debaters are known for their ready adaptability, and Assertive Debaters are somewhat more likely to say that stress actually helps them focus. Their Turbulent counterparts are much less likely to feel that they can effectively manage the stress in their lives, and they more often take steps to avoid it. 64% of Turbulent Debaters find it hard not to let a moderately stressful event affect them negatively, versus just 20% of Assertive Debaters. \u201cHandling Stress\u201d Survey It\u2019s worth noting that these two personality variants have somewhat differing responses to stress. Assertive Debaters are a bit more likely to engage in physical activity as an outlet, while Turbulent Debaters are prone to being even more talkative than normal. Unfortunately, Turbulent Debaters are also more prone to struggling with negative self-perception. They\u2019re less likely to be satisfied when looking back on their life overall or even just with their physical appearance. 53% of Turbulent Debaters say they are generally happy with the way they look, compared to 84% of Assertive Debaters. \u201cBody Image\u201d Survey While the Turbulent personality trait can make some less comfortable with themselves, Debaters of both Identities have roughly similar boldness and optimism overall. Interestingly, it\u2019s the Turbulent ones who are less likely to ask for help, often because they fear it may make them look weak. It\u2019s also important to mention that compared to Assertive Debaters, Turbulent Debaters are significantly more likely to agree that negative emotions affect their ability to think clearly and significantly less likely to feel like they have control over their emotions. Summary Turbulent Debaters are more likely to seek social approval than Assertive Debaters, who are usually more self-confident. Assertive Debater personalities are less easily provoked than their Turbulent counterparts, who tend to be reactive, especially to criticism. Turbulent Debaters are more likely to talk about their feelings and put significant effort into controlling negative feelings, while Assertive Debaters are less prone to self-examination or shame. Assertive Debaters are less affected by stress; Turbulent Debaters often have a hard time managing even moderate stress. Turbulent Debaters are more likely to be upset or assign blame over their failures, whereas their Assertive counterparts are less bothered, even when someone else is superior. Assertive Debaters tend to have a more positive self-view than their Turbulent cousins, who are more likely to see fault in themselves and their lives. Despite these noted differences, Debaters are more alike than not. The qualities that make this personality type stand out are vivid, regardless of their Identity. Some Debaters may feel the effects of misfortune or doubt more keenly, but they usually bounce back in their own way, just as determined to triumph. In the end, both Assertive and Turbulent Debaters often share similar paths in life, even if they walk with slightly different gaits and falter for different reasons. Most importantly, this personality type can overcome any pitfalls of either Identity trait through awareness and practice. Given that they have so many habits and qualities in common, learning about their respective Identity differences is a great way for all Debaters to make strides in their personal growth."}]}

People with this personality type rarely settle for anything that falls short of their ideals, and their romantic relationships are no exception. Protagonists want to fall in love with the content of a person\u2019s character and the tenor of their soul \u2013 not just the way they look from across the room. Although these personalities may come across as outgoing or even a bit flirtatious, few Protagonists are satisfied by fleeting attractions. Their standards are high, and they know it. In fact, this awareness might give Protagonists a deeper appreciation of just how rare and precious it is to feel a real spark with another person \u2013 and, in turn, just how rare and special it is when that spark grows into the steady flames of true, abiding love. Moving Beyond the Dating Game When Protagonists fall for someone, they tend to fall hard \u2013 and they\u2019re not coy about it. Protagonists are among the personality types that most readily express how they feel, so they often find themselves making the first move, rather than playing games or waiting for reassurance that the other person feels the same way. In the dating world, Protagonists\u2019 willingness to put themselves out there can be refreshing and more than a little unusual. This, along with the intensity of their passion, is incredibly appealing to many people. That said, because Protagonists do so often make the first move, they may encounter their share of rejection as they search for a kindred spirit. People with the Protagonist personality type are eager to prove their commitment, taking the time and effort to establish themselves as dependable, trustworthy partners. Dreaming Together Even on the first date, these personalities may steer the conversation toward weightier topics. Protagonists don\u2019t just want to find out what TV shows someone watches \u2013 they want to get a sense of their partner\u2019s dreams and aspirations, the changes they hope to make to themselves and to the world. And as the relationship deepens, Protagonists take pride in supporting their partner to make good on these dreams. For Protagonists, one of life\u2019s greatest joys is helping someone they care about reach their goals. Some Protagonists carry this a step further, taking on their partner\u2019s goals as their own. This can be problematic, to say the least. If Protagonist personalities become overinvested in helping their partner, they may end up neglecting their own self-care, hobbies, and friendships. They may also be at risk of pushing their partner to change their life in ways that they simply aren\u2019t ready for. When Protagonists carry this too far, they often find that the pressure they put on their partner to \u201cbetter\u201d themselves backfires in one of two ways. Their partner may become insecure, fearing that they aren\u2019t good enough as they are, or they may become angry, feeling resentful of the implication that they need to change. Either way, Protagonists must learn to encourage their partner to grow without pushing too hard. The Long Haul Few personality types are keener than Protagonists to establish a loving commitment with their chosen partner. They take dating and relationships seriously. Even in the earliest days of a relationship, Protagonists tend to focus on long-term potential, and as the relationship matures, they want to do what it takes to bring that potential to fruition. While Protagonists certainly know how to enjoy the moment, they also know that love isn\u2019t all fun and games. This can be a beautiful thing. Protagonists care about pleasing their partner, and their sensitivity helps them tune in to their partner\u2019s shifting moods and desires. As long as they don\u2019t lose track of their own needs, people with this personality type can enjoy incredibly rewarding relationships that are founded on trust, mutual support, and honesty \u2013 and, of course, love."}]}

A Logician (INTP) is someone with the Introverted , Intuitive , Thinking , and Prospecting personality traits. These flexible thinkers enjoy taking an unconventional approach to many aspects of life. They often seek out unlikely paths, mixing willingness to experiment with personal creativity. The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. ALBERT EINSTEIN Logicians pride themselves on their unique perspectives and vigorous intellect. They can\u2019t help but puzzle over the mysteries of the universe \u2013 which may explain why some of the most influential philosophers and scientists of all time have been Logicians. This personality type is fairly rare, but with their creativity and inventiveness, Logicians aren\u2019t afraid to stand out from the crowd. The Life of the Mind Logicians often lose themselves in thought \u2013 which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. People with this personality type hardly ever stop thinking. From the moment they wake up, their minds buzz with ideas, questions, and insights. At times, they may even find themselves conducting full-fledged debates in their own heads. Imaginative and curious, Logician personalities can find endless fascination in the workings of their own mind. From the outside, Logicians may seem to live in a never-ending daydream. They have a reputation for being pensive, detached, and a bit reserved. That is, until they try to train all of their mental energy on the moment or the person at hand, which can be a bit uncomfortable for everyone. But regardless of which mode they\u2019re in, Logicians are Introverts and tend to get tired out by extensive socializing. After a long day, they crave time alone to consult their own thoughts. But it would be a mistake to think that Logicians are unfriendly or uptight. When they connect with someone who can match their mental energy, these personalities absolutely light up, leaping from one thought to another. Few things energize them like the opportunity to swap ideas or enjoy a lively debate with another curious, inquiring soul. Elementary, My Dear Logician Logicians love to analyze patterns. Without necessarily knowing how they do it, people with this personality type often have a Sherlock Holmes\u2013like knack for spotting discrepancies and irregularities. In other words, it\u2019s a bad idea to lie to them. Ironically, Logicians shouldn\u2019t always be held at their word. They rarely mean to be dishonest, but with their active minds, they sometimes overflow with ideas and theories that they haven\u2019t thought through all the way. They may change their mind on anything from their weekend plans to a fundamental moral principle, without ever realizing that they\u2019d appeared to have made up their mind in the first place. In addition, they are often happy to play devil\u2019s advocate in order to keep an interesting discussion humming along. For Logicians, the best conversations are like brainstorming sessions, with plenty of room for unconventional thoughts and off-the-wall what-ifs. Logicians could spend all day musing about ideas and possibilities \u2013 and they often do. That said, the practical, everyday work of turning those ideas into reality doesn\u2019t always hold their interest. Fortunately, when it comes to dissecting a tricky, multilayered problem and coming up with a creative solution, few personality types can match Logicians\u2019 creative genius and potential. Mysteries of the Universe People with this personality type want to understand everything in the universe, but one area in particular tends to mystify them: human nature. As their name suggests, Logicians feel most at home in the realm of logic and rationality. As a result, they can find themselves baffled by the illogical, irrational ways that feelings and emotions influence people\u2019s behavior \u2013 including their own. This doesn\u2019t mean that Logicians are unfeeling. These personalities generally want to offer emotional support to their friends and loved ones, but they don\u2019t necessarily know how. And because they can\u2019t decide on the best, most efficient way to offer support, they may hold off on doing or saying anything at all. This \u201canalysis paralysis\u201d can affect multiple areas of Logicians\u2019 lives. People with this personality type can overthink even the smallest of decisions. This makes them feel ineffective and stuck, so exhausted by the endless parade of thoughts in their mind that they struggle to get things done. The good news is that Logicians don\u2019t have to stay stuck for long. Their unique strengths include everything they need to pull themselves out of the ruts that they occasionally fall into. By leveraging their creativity and their open-mindedness, Logicians can reach their full potential \u2013 both as thinkers and as happy, well-rounded people."}]}

But people with this personality type prize something else as well: intellectual depth. Not everyone will meet Logicians\u2019 standards for a potential friend, but when someone does, the connection can spark instantly, surprising everyone who thought they had this seemingly distant personality type pegged. Choosy or Selective? Perhaps because they don\u2019t mind the company of their own thoughts, Logicians don\u2019t surround themselves with people just for the sake of it. As a result, it\u2019s not always easy to become close friends with these personalities. But when Logicians do open up, they can be lively, imaginative friends who always have something interesting or unexpected to say. Logicians\u2019 best friends tend to share their passion for new ideas, riddles, and solutions. But that doesn\u2019t mean that people with this personality type only seek out friends who agree with them. Logicians don\u2019t mind having their ideas challenged \u2013 in fact, they have a great deal of respect for people who make them rethink their assumptions and keep them on their toes. Logician friendships are knowledge-based, buoyed by the exchange of ideas, theories, and concepts. People who aren\u2019t able to keep up or who have sharply differing tastes (don\u2019t talk to Logicians about celebrities) may find themselves feeling ignored or brushed off. Logicians reserve conversation for topics that they find meaningful or for people they already like enough to stick it out. Logicians\u2019 intellectual style isn\u2019t for everyone, but that\u2019s okay. Most people with this personality type prefer to have a small circle of good friends. The Meaning of Friendship When friends come to them with problems and dilemmas, Logicians are generally excited to help. They can be counted on to offer logical advice and rational solutions, turning even the messiest of situations into a pros-and-cons list. But when it comes to emotional support or matters of the heart, people with this personality type may feel a bit out of their depth. For Logicians, one of the greatest (and most difficult) lessons of friendship is that sometimes people don\u2019t need advice on how to solve their problems \u2013 they just need someone they can count on to be by their side. Logicians tend to believe that their greatest strength lies in their mind. But the experience of friendship can help them realize that they have more to offer the world than their ideas, no matter how original or groundbreaking those ideas may be. Over time, many Logicians learn that lively conversations and all-night brainstorming sessions may be fun, but they\u2019re not all that friendship is about. These personalities have an uncanny ability to see past superficial trappings, such as social status or how someone dresses, and appreciate the full potential of the person inside. In a world obsessed with fitting in, Logicians can inspire their friends to buck convention, ignore trends, and find their unique voices."}]}

An Entertainer (ESFP) is a person with the Extraverted , Observant , Feeling , and Prospecting personality traits. These people love vibrant experiences, engaging in life eagerly and taking pleasure in discovering the unknown. They can be very social, often encouraging others into shared activities. Live for each second without hesitation. ELTON JOHN If anyone is to be found spontaneously breaking into song and dance, it is the Entertainer personality type. Entertainers get caught up in the excitement of the moment, and want everyone else to feel that way, too. No other personality type is as generous with their time and energy as Entertainers when it comes to encouraging others, and no other personality type does it with such irresistible style. Living with Passion Entertainers love the spotlight, and all the world\u2019s a stage. Many famous people with the Entertainer personality type are indeed actors, but they love putting on a show for their friends too, chatting with a unique and earthy wit, soaking up attention and making every outing feel a bit like a party. Utterly social, Entertainers enjoy the simplest things, and there\u2019s no greater joy for them than just having fun with a good group of friends. It\u2019s not just talk either \u2013 Entertainers have the strongest aesthetic sense of any personality type. From grooming and outfits to a well-appointed home, Entertainer personalities have an eye for fashion. Knowing what\u2019s attractive the moment they see it, Entertainers aren\u2019t afraid to change their surroundings to reflect their personal style. Entertainers are naturally curious, exploring new designs and styles with ease. Though it may not always seem like it, Entertainers know that it\u2019s not all about them \u2013 they are observant, and very sensitive to others\u2019 emotions. People with this personality type are often the first to help someone talk out a challenging problem, happily providing emotional support and practical advice. However, if the problem is about them, Entertainers are more likely to avoid a conflict altogether than to address it head-on. Entertainers usually love a little drama and passion, but not so much when they are the focus of the criticisms it can bring. A Spontaneous Spirit The biggest challenge Entertainers face is that they are often so focused on immediate pleasures that they neglect the duties and responsibilities that make those luxuries possible. Complex analysis, repetitive tasks, and matching statistics to real consequences are not easy activities for Entertainers. They\u2019d rather rely on luck or opportunity, or simply ask for help from their extensive circle of friends. It is important for Entertainers to challenge themselves to keep track of long-term things like their retirement plans or sugar intake \u2013 there won\u2019t always be someone else around who can help to keep an eye on these things. Entertainers recognize value and quality, which on its own is a fine trait. In combination with their tendency to be poor planners though, this can cause them to live beyond their means, and credit cards are especially dangerous. More focused on leaping at opportunities than in planning out long-term goals, Entertainers may find that their inattentiveness has made some activities unaffordable. There\u2019s nothing that makes Entertainers feel quite as unhappy as realizing that they are boxed in by circumstance, unable to join their friends. Entertainers are welcome wherever there\u2019s a need for laughter, playfulness, and a volunteer to try something new and fun \u2013 and there\u2019s no greater joy for Entertainer personalities than to bring everyone else along for the ride. Entertainers can chat for hours, sometimes about anything but the topic they meant to talk about, and share their loved ones\u2019 emotions through good times and bad. If they can just remember to keep their ducks in a row, they\u2019ll always be ready to dive into all the new and exciting things the world has to offer, friends in tow."}]}

They can reframe nearly any challenge as an opportunity to hone their rational thinking skills and expand their knowledge \u2013 and with this mindset, they can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems. Informed \u2013 Few personality types are as devoted as Architects to developing rational, correct, and evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the conviction that they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement. Independent \u2013 For these personalities, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, Architects strive to do things their own way. They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing arbitrary rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success. Determined \u2013 This personality type is known for being ambitious and goal-oriented. Architects won\u2019t rest until they\u2019ve achieved their own definition of success \u2013 which usually entails mastering the subjects and pursuits that matter to them. Curious \u2013 Architects are open to new ideas \u2013 as long as those ideas are rational and evidence-based, that is. Skeptical by nature, Architects are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. And if the facts prove them wrong, they are generally happy to revise their opinions. Original \u2013 Without Architects, the world would be a far less interesting place. This personality type\u2019s rebellious streak is responsible for some of history\u2019s most unconventional ideas and inventions. Even in their everyday lives, Architects force the people around them to consider new (and sometimes startling) ways of looking at things. Architect (INTJ) Weaknesses Arrogant \u2013 Architects might be knowledgeable, but they\u2019re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful input from other people \u2013 especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. These personalities can also come across as needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong. Dismissive of Emotions \u2013 For Architects, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias \u2013 one that can cloud Architects\u2019 judgment. Overly Critical \u2013 These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, Architects can appear scathingly critical. But this criticism can be unfair, based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature. Combative \u2013 Architects hate blindly following anything without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations \u2013 but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters. Socially Clueless \u2013 Architects\u2019 relentless rationality can lead to frustration in their social lives. Their efforts to defy expectations may leave them feeling isolated or disconnected from other people. At times, they may become cynical about the value of relationships altogether, questioning the importance of love and connection."}]}

It\u2019s getting beneath the surface to become Virtuosos\u2019 true friends that is the real challenge, leaving them with a lot of good will and friendly faces to call on, but only a few people who they feel truly understand them. Keeping It Spontaneous A lot of this comes down to Virtuosos simply not wanting to be bound to any particular person or activity. Virtuoso personalities live in the present, enjoying whatever life brings, and feel no real obligation to shift course on account of others\u2019 plans. If friends don\u2019t want to do what Virtuosos are doing, then they are free to go do their own thing, and they\u2019ll hang out some other time. Sometimes their shifts in attitude can catch their friends flat-footed, but Virtuosos\u2019 motto remains \u201ceverything can be changed\u201d. Forcing them to constantly commit to scheduled activities is probably the quickest way to end these friendships. As long as everyone keeps things relaxed and flexible though, Virtuosos\u2019 friendships can be rich and rewarding. People with this personality type are talented when it comes to using their senses, and usually enjoy a little competition. This makes Virtuosos\u2019 hobbies, especially the more physical activities like fishing and crafts, especially enjoyable with a little company, and they are usually the basis for their friendships. Virtuosos\u2019 interests are pretty diverse, so they should have no trouble coming up with exciting things to do. Virtuoso personalities are also thoughtful, rational people. Being fairly creative individuals themselves, they often enjoy discussing new ideas \u2013 but in the end, the point of sharing those ideas needs to be to take action. Dreaming is well and good, but talk is cheap, and discussions on abstract or distant subjects like Eurasian politics can only hold Virtuosos\u2019 attention for so long before they decide to shift their focus to something they can do. This makes friendships with Intuitive (N) types, who have a much less physical approach to life, challenging for Virtuosos to maintain. With their enjoyment of firsthand experience, these personalities just feel more comfortable alongside other personality types with the Observant (S) trait. So long as they share a hobby, philosophical differences and contrasting world views really don\u2019t matter too much \u2013 it\u2019s what people do that matters to Virtuosos. The Surprising Charm of Being Yourself Virtuosos are unusually popular, almost in spite of themselves. Their open-mindedness, interesting hobbies and relaxed attitude are attractive to a remarkably broad range of personality types. With so many acquaintances, Virtuosos are sure to strike up deeper friendships with at least a few."}]}

People with this personality type believe in the power and beauty of true love, and they sincerely hope never to settle for anything less. It\u2019s fair to say, then, that Mediators approach the world of romance with high expectations. They may have spent years daydreaming about the perfect relationship, imagining how it would feel to share their innermost selves with another person. But the reality of dating can come as something of a shock to Mediators, forcing them to grapple with a challenging question: If they want to be in a relationship, will they have to compromise on their ideals? Hopeless Romantics Mediators don\u2019t just want to find a partner \u2013 they want to connect with a soul mate. Thoughtful and open-minded, these personalities are generally willing to consider going out with all sorts of people. Mediators pride themselves on their ability to look past a potential partner\u2019s superficial traits \u2013 such as appearance, social status, or possessions \u2013 and focus on deeper, more meaningful signals of compatibility. Mediators share a belief that two people can come together in a relationship and make each other better and happier than they were before. But it would be a mistake to think that Mediators don\u2019t have preconceived standards for a significant other. With their active minds and imaginations, people with this personality type tend to develop and carry with them a vision of their ideal partner \u2013 a vision that may be based on a favorite fictional character, a person they once knew, or simply the stories they\u2019ve told themselves about how love \u201cshould\u201d look. When they meet someone new, most Mediators can\u2019t help but compare that person with the ideal soul mate they\u2019ve envisioned. Unsurprisingly, such comparisons tend to weed out more than a few potential partners. It can be difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 for a real, flesh-and-blood person to live up to a Mediator\u2019s cherished dreams. Making an Effort With time, many Mediators come to learn that true love doesn\u2019t just magically happen \u2013 it takes compromise, understanding, and work. After all, no partner is perfect, and even the most beautiful relationships have their challenges. Fortunately, people with this personality type can find a great deal of joy in the effort it takes to strengthen a relationship. When they fall in love, Mediators reveal just how much passion thrums beneath their quiet exteriors. Devoted and loyal, they nevertheless respect their partner\u2019s independence, aiming to accept their partners as they are. That said, these personalities also want to help their partners learn, grow, and pursue their goals. Mediators are always dreaming up ways to improve themselves and the world around them, and the last thing they\u2019d want is for their partners to feel unhappy or stuck. Mediator personalities use their compassion and insight to understand the people they care about, and they draw on their creativity to make their partner feel special. Many people with this personality type dedicate themselves to helping their partners improve their lives. While this is a noble goal, Mediators must be sure to keep track of their own needs and make sure that their partners are really ready to change. Provided they do so, Mediators\u2019 support and devotion can make all the difference in their partners\u2019 lives. Finding What\u2019s Real Mediators tend to promote harmony over disagreement. Although this lends stability to their relationships, it can also lead to problems. To avoid triggering a conflict, Mediators may avoid talking openly about things that are bothering them \u2013 instead, they might mentally fixate on the problem or try to solve it on their own. They may also focus on making their partner happy, to the detriment of their own priorities and sense of self. People with this personality type may need to remind themselves that open, honest communication is necessary in a relationship, even if it isn\u2019t always easy. In fact, such moments of candor can transform a relationship for the better. As long as they communicate openly, Mediators are more than capable of staying true to themselves in a relationship \u2013 and encouraging the person they care about to do the same. By bringing their whole hearts and minds to their relationships, Mediators can find out what it truly means to love and be loved."}]}

Life is fun and full of surprises (something Entrepreneurs have particular skill in delivering), and they enjoy it all in the here and now. Entrepreneurs may not spend a lot of time planning for \u201csomeday\u201d, but their enthusiasm and unpredictability make them thrilling dating partners. Entrepreneurs\u2019 relationships are far from boring. Their improvisational style creates a seemingly never-ending list of activities and hobbies to be involved in, and Entrepreneurs fully encourage their partners to partake. Entrepreneurs love new ideas and the occasional philosophical discussion \u2013 but they need to be topics that can explored through action together, not just idle talk. There\u2019s musing about the causes and effects of epidemic obesity, and there\u2019s training for a marathon together to promote healthy living. The Challenge of Intimacy Sexually, Entrepreneurs have no real reservations. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s physically enjoyable, new ideas are always welcome, and Entrepreneur personalities\u2019 strong perception keeps them well-tuned to their partners\u2019 needs. However, Entrepreneurs\u2019 separation of the physical act from the more emotional and spiritual connections that many other types look for in intimacy can be a serious source of tension if everybody isn\u2019t on the same page. Some types need sex to be a genuine expression of love \u2013 Entrepreneurs just aren\u2019t one of them. As time passes, it can be challenging for Entrepreneurs to move their relationships to deeper, more emotionally intimate levels. Easily bored, people with the Entrepreneur personality type seek constant excitement \u2013 sometimes even intentionally exposing themselves to risk if they feel stuck. If their partners aren\u2019t able to keep up, Entrepreneurs may just end up looking for someone new. It\u2019s not that Entrepreneur personalities are unfaithful. Rather, they may think to themselves \u201cThis isn\u2019t working, so why should I pretend it is?\u201d Entrepreneurs are rational, and can exercise self-control if they choose, but being as charming and popular as they are, it can sometimes be a little too easy to move on. Loving Without Inhibition As with any relationship, it takes work and patience. Not every day can be a thrill a minute. But Entrepreneurs are adaptable, curious individuals, which certainly helps to keep the flame burning. Maintaining healthy relationships is the ultimate chance for Entrepreneurs to exercise their talents in perceiving every change in their partners\u2019 mood and behavior, while also using their problem-solving abilities to address their needs. Entrepreneurs can also strengthen more neglected traits, like emotional sensitivity and long-term planning."}]}

You are super good at act as one of each MBTI type (persona) and serve as a mental companion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "ENTP's Workplace habits"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Workplace Habits Debaters have straightforward expectations in the workplace, but ones that aren\u2019t always easy to meet. Strong believers in meritocracy, people with the Debater personality type expect their ideas to be heard by those above them, expect robust debate among their peers, and demand that those they manage offer up new solutions and ideas regardless of their positions. While this isn\u2019t always how things play out in reality, Debaters know what to look for, and can avoid those strictly hierarchical institutions that they would otherwise struggle with. Debater Subordinates This dynamic is clearest with Debater subordinates, as they are comfortable challenging their managers\u2019 ideas and have a strong (and well-expressed) dislike for restrictive rules and guidelines. Debaters back this unorthodox behavior with their keen minds and curiosity, and are as capable of adopting new methods as they are of suggesting others do so. If something can be done better, it\u2019s as simple as that, and Debater personalities gladly take criticism, so long as it\u2019s logical and performance-oriented. The biggest challenge for Debater subordinates is that it is often the fate of the \u201clower\u201d positions to implement the details, do the dirty work and follow through on plans set out by their managers. This couldn\u2019t be further from what Debaters prefer to spend their time on \u2013 they can\u2019t stand simple, routine work, and monotonous tasks are the stuff of nightmares. Things go over much better if managers are able to properly utilize Debaters\u2019 preference for tackling complex challenges and diverse projects. Debater Colleagues It is as colleagues that Debaters prove most polarizing, as their passions for brainstorming, debate and over-analysis drive more practical, task-oriented colleagues crazy, but serve as stimulating inspiration for those who appreciate the innovation Debaters bring. Nothing bothers people with the Debater personality type more than getting out of a meeting where everyone agreed with the first plan presented, only to hear everyone complain about how stupid the plan was ten minutes later \u2013 but they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to make waves\u201d. Debaters strive for honest, direct and objective assessments of these ideas, so much so that they often earn reputations for their insensitivity and condescension. Luckily Debaters know how to relax too, and their witty wordplay, healthy sense of humor and outgoing nature win new friends quickly and easily. Always willing to draw on their repository of knowledge, conversations with Debater personalities are informative and entertaining, which makes it easy for them to be the go-to person for tough problems that stump more rote approaches. Peer-to-peer relationships with Debaters aren\u2019t always easy, but it\u2019s tough to argue that they don\u2019t work. Debater Managers While not always their goal, management is often where Debaters are most at home, allowing them the freedom to fiddle with different approaches and come up with innovative ways to tackle new challenges without having to handle the tedious step-by-step implementation of these plans. Debaters are open-minded and flexible managers, not just granting but also expecting the same freedom of thought that they themselves enjoy. This can lead to disorder, conflicting ideas and approaches being put forward, but Debaters are also great at accurately and objectively assessing which plan is likely to be most effective. This doesn\u2019t always make friends, but being liked is less Debaters\u2019 goal than being respected and seen as intelligent and capable. And liked or no, people with this personality type hold firm ground in rational debates, making them fearsome advocates for their teams. The challenge for Debaters is focus, as they may find themselves jumping from project to project in a quest for challenge and excitement before their teams are able to wrap up the details of their existing goals and obligations."}]}

For people with the Debater personality type growth is key, and even before they\u2019ve found a dating partner, they imagine all the ways that they can experience new things together, to grow in tandem. This can be an overwhelming process if their partner doesn\u2019t match up, but when Debaters find someone who shares their love of intellectual exploration, watch out. Sparks May Fly From the earliest dates, Debaters test their partners\u2019 limits for this kind of potential, pushing boundaries and traditions, looking for open-mindedness and spontaneity. Dating Debater personalities is hardly a boring experience, and they make use of their enthusiasm and creativity by delighting and surprising their partners with new ideas and experiences. Debaters\u2019 idea of fun is often rooted in self-improvement, and people with this personality type bring their partners along the way, as much in a spirit of sharing as in a spirit of expectation. Debaters see either growth or stagnation and don\u2019t buy into the idea of a happy status quo, making them demanding as much as they are exciting. Some may tire in the face of this constant improvement \u2013 while Debaters\u2019 vigor can be attractive, it can also wear down even the most patient partners. A little time to breathe and a chance to rest on one\u2019s laurels for a moment is necessary for many people, but not something Debaters are likely to appreciate. However, if their unwavering enthusiasm is met in kind, it can lead to a magnificent relationship characterized by its strength, depth, and spark. Opportunities for Growth This is perhaps most evident as Debaters\u2019 relationships progress into more intimate situations. All that exploratory curiosity and enthusiasm has a chance to be expressed in new ways when Debaters and their partners come together, and they readily encourage their partners to try new things, to enjoy their intimacy without preconceived limitations. For people with the Debater personality type, this phase of their relationships is a chance to improve and develop in areas that are outside the realm of academia, though they approach it in much the same way \u2013 as a physical and intellectual process of striving towards excellence, rather than a spiritual or emotional expression of affection. Debaters\u2019 desire to improve in this department makes them fantastic partners when the relationship reaches that point, but their attitude towards this process is also evidence of their most glaring shortcoming \u2013 their emotional obliviousness. While Debaters are more open-minded than other Analyst personality types about others\u2019 perspectives, they are also more likely to express their disdain for such things as emotional sensitivity in cuttingly well-phrased and clear terms, easily hurting their partners\u2019 feelings without realizing it. Debater personalities may even ignore their partners\u2019 feelings altogether, instead immersing themselves entirely in some distant idea or opportunity, inaccessible. Where Debaters\u2019 unwavering desire for self-improvement comes in most handy is in their emotional development, as they may actually be willing to work on areas such as sensitivity and emotional communication with their partners. Debaters\u2019 best compatibility rests with other Intuitive (N) types, with one or two opposing traits which help to create both balance and opportunities for growth. If they are with a more sensitive partner, this can be an excellent way for them to find another quality that they can work on together, making this weakness yet another opportunity to be creative, challenge themselves, and to deepen the attractiveness that this sense of progression brings to their relationships."}]}
